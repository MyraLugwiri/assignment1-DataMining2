0,War in Ukraine,"Calvin Eng, the owner of New York-based Cantonese-American restaurant Bonnie’s, isn’t shy about his love for monosodium glutamate. Case in point – he has the letters “MSG” tattooed on his arm, and his restaurant’s menu includes a signature drink called the MSG Martini. “Things just taste better with MSG, whether it’s Western food or Cantonese food,” the chef tells CNN. “We use it in drinks. We use it in desserts. We use it in savory food. It’s in almost everything. Salt, sugar and MSG – I always joke that they’re the Chinese Trinity of seasonings.” Openly admitting to using MSG – once a surefire way to keep your restaurant empty – certainly hasn’t undermined Bonnie’s success. It’s become one of the hottest tables in New York since opening in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in late 2021, winning numerous Best New Restaurant awards from multiple media outlets. Eng himself was named one of the best new chefs of 2022 by Food and Wine Magazine and was included on the 2023 Forbes 30 under 30 list, just to name a few of his recent achievements. Eng is one of several celebrated chefs, including Momofuku’s David Chang and author/chef Eddie Huang, now embracing MSG and trying to destigmatize the century-old seasoning. “Growing up, it was taboo to use MSG,” says Eng. “My mom would never use it, but she’d use chicken powder in her cooking. As a kid, I didn’t know they were like the same thing until I was old enough to care to know about it.” Here’s a quick recap of MSG’s history: In 1907, Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda boiled down a huge amount of kombu seaweed to extract a substance – glutamate. Why? It gives certain foods, like dashi broth, a long-lasting savory flavor. He coined the taste “umami,” then broke the substance down into MSG, which as a crystallized substance can be used like salt and sugar. A year later, businessman Saburosuke Suzuki acquired a joint share of the MSG patent and, with Ikeda, founded the company Ajinomoto to manufacture the seasoning. It soon became an award-winning invention and a prized condiment, especially among middle-class housewives in Japan. In the decades to come, it became well-known around the world. The US military even held the first-ever MSG symposium after World War II to discuss how the seasoning could be used to make tastier field rations and boost soldiers’ morale. But MSG’s fortunes began to go downhill in 1968, when a US doctor wrote a letter to a medical journal titled “Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.” In the document, he described symptoms like “numbness in the back of the neck,” “general weakness” and “palpitations.” He suspected MSG, along with other ingredients like cooking wine and high amounts of sodium, may have caused these symptoms. MSG took the biggest hit, with the effects of that letter rippling on throughout the decades, all over the world. Restaurants publicly swore off MSG. Food and beverage publicists begged not to be asked about it. Diners experiencing discomfort after a meal blamed it on MSG. “Many didn’t know that MSG is plant-derived,” says Tia Rains, a Chicago-based nutrition scientist and Ajinomoto’s vice president of customer engagement and strategic development. “Our process [of making MSG] is by fermentation, which is very similar to how beer is brewed or how yogurt is made.” First, plants with sugar – like sugarcanes or corn – are fermented with microbes to create glutamate, an amino acid found in food that’s also produced in our body and acts as a neurotransmitter. Then, sodium is added and the glutamate is crystalized to become the salt-like MSG we see in supermarkets and kitchens now. “I’m a scientist by training. I think how MSG works is one of the coolest scientific things,” says Rains. “We have different receptors on our tongue for different tastes. Our receptor for umami looks almost like a Venus Flytrap under a microscope,” she adds, mimicking a “C” with her hand. “Glutamate is the amino acid that has the snug fit to that receptor.” So what’s umami? In recent years it’s been called “the fifth taste” – joining the more familiar tastes of sweet, sour, salty and bitter – and is often described as savory. When the glutamate goes into the receptor, it causes an umami flavor sensation on our tongue. If the food has one of the two nucleotides – inosinate and guanylate – the glutamate is able to stick to the receptor for a longer period. “In layman’s terms, if you want to make an umami bomb, combine the glutamate – which is the core in creating umami – with one of these nucleotides (inosinate and guanylate). It’s like getting multiple hits of umami to your brain,” Rains explains. Sounds complicated? You’ve probably been playing with glutamate, inosinate and guanylate in your own cooking without even realizing it. Carrots and onions (high in glutamate), for example, boost the umami-ness in beef (high in inosinate). Bonito fish (inosinate) and seaweed kombu (glutamate) also combine to create a powerful umami flavor. Foods like tomatoes and cheese even have natural glutamate in them. “When people tell me that they ate at a Chinese food restaurant and they had trouble breathing and tightness in their chest, I get worried – and I’d say, ‘you need to follow up on that because MSG is not an allergen. It’s not going to cause an allergic response. Our bodies make glutamate, so it would not be possible to have an allergy to glutamate’,” says Rains. Despite continued claims of negative reactions to MSG from diners, decades of scientific trials have failed to prove the existence of MSG sensitivity. Government organizations around the world have listed MSG as safe to eat. This includes the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which lists MSG as “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS). “Although many people identify themselves as sensitive to MSG, in studies with such individuals given MSG or a placebo, scientists have not been able to consistently trigger reactions,” says the FDA’s website. The Centre for Food Safety in Hong Kong notes that using MSG could reduce sodium intake, which is known for health issues like high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. “When used in combination with a small amount of salt during food preparation, MSG has been reported to reduce the total amount of sodium in a recipe by 20 to 40%,” said a food safety assessment carried out by a Hong Kong government scientific officer. Yet negative opinions continue to permeate discussions on MSG, leaving the marketing team of Ajinomoto busy as it works to change attitudes. “All these years later, we haven’t really made a dent in sodium levels in the food supply, at least in the US,” says Rains. “We’ve got a tool to help product developers get there and we’re not using it because of a silly, outdated, xenophobic and potentially racist negativity around a food ingredient that has been consumed for over 100 years. It was too big of a challenge to walk away from.” In 2020, the team successfully lobbied Merriam-Webster to change the definition of Chinese Restaurant Syndrome in its dictionary and has hosted symposiums to educate the public about MSG and umami. There’s even a visitors’ center at Ajinomoto’s oldest factory, in Kawasaki, where the remaining crystals of the first-ever MSG created by Ikeda more than a century ago are proudly on display. It also showcases the history of MSG and features a diorama that explains how MSG is made. The tour, mostly in Japanese, is open to the public and is free of charge. Visitors, usually school children, bottle their own MSG keychains and shave bonito flakes to learn more about umami. Then they tour the 370,000-square-feet complex on a panda bus – nicknamed after the company’s mascot, Ajipanda – while smiling staff wave them goodbye from the door. Nowadays, chefs like Eng aren’t afraid of talking about MSG and listing it on their menus, which is helping to change outdated mindsets. “I think our clientele is a young crowd who understands MSG and isn’t afraid to consume it,” he says. “We’re proud to embrace the use of it to help destigmatize the reputation or negative connotation that it does have.” Health concerns aside, some diners simply view the use of MSG as a shortcut – an easy flavor enhancer. Eng disagrees with this take, noting their dishes are created the traditional way. “We still make our stocks and broths with bones for hours. We season our food with MSG a little bit – it’s different from heating water and adding MSG and serving it with noodles,” he says. Many of Bonnie’s dishes are classic Cantonese dishes but with playful and laborious twists. For instance, the cha siu bkrib sandwich was inspired by two foods – the classic McDonald’s McRib sandwich and a traditional Cantonese steamed black bean and ribs dish Eng’s mother – Bonnie – loves making. To make the sandwich, Eng steams the ribs until the bones can be easily removed from the meat. Then he marinates the deboned rib meat with a house-made charsiu sauce – made with hoisin sauce, maltose, fermented red soy curd, MSG and more – overnight. When the meat is ready, it’s pressed and flattened out for a few hours before being glazed and roasted in the oven. Finally, Eng places a big slab of the rib meat, onions, pickles and mustard on a Cantonese “zyu zai” bun – a classic type of soft bun bought from his mom’s favorite Cantonese bakery in Chinatown. It’s been the hottest item on the menu since Bonnie’s opened. “Our mission from the very beginning was to show people what Cantonese food is and what Cantonese food can be – it’s always going to be playful, fun and approachable,” says Eng. But while opinions towards MSG may be slowly changing in the United States, the same can not be said for the rest of the world. “Depending on where you’re at it could be very negative or very positive,” says Rains. The expert hopes that as the reputation of MSG improves in the United States, it may influence places where MSG is still a forbidden topic. “Negativity around MSG originated here in the United States,” says Rains. “It wouldn’t be unreasonable to think that if we could make a dent here in the US, share the facts and have people understand the ingredient, that it may reverberate throughout the world in the future.”",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/msg-changing-views-cmd/index.html,"calvin eng owner new yorkbased cantoneseamerican restaurant bonnie ’ ’ shy love monosodium

1,California flooding,"As with many Target trips, Nevada US history teacher Tierra Espy left the store with more items than she intended to buy on Sunday. She added a magnetic activity book about iconic Civil Rights leaders to her cart, in time for Black History Month, she told CNN in a phone interview. But now, Target is pulling the item off shelves after a viral TikTok in which Espy pointed out inaccuracies such as misidentifying names and pictures of iconic Civil Rights leaders. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune first reported the news. The activity book had mixed up the names and images of Carter G. Woodson, a pioneer in the study of African-American history; W.E.B. Du Bois, a sociologist, historian, author and activist; and Booker T. Washington, an educator and intellectual who was the first president of what is now Tuskegee University. In a statement Friday, Target said it “will no longer be selling this product in stores or online. We’ve also ensured the product’s publisher is aware of the errors.” Misidentifying Black people and other people of color can play into racist tropes by suggesting non-White people all look alike. The trope has often been used to dehumanize non-White people. And blunders like this have happened before. Last year, decorated Olympian Simone Biles called out the Wall Street Journal after an article it published about her featured a photo of a different Black gymnast. The Civil Rights leaders book was available in Target’s Dollar Spot section, Espy said, the prominent display at the front of the store where most items are priced between $1 to $5. The magnetic book was displayed next to other educational items for Black History month. On Monday night, Espy opened the book to put the magnets on the fridge for her children. “As soon as I saw the mistake I’m like, ‘Oh no, I can’t put this up,’” she told CNN. “They’re expecting us not to notice the mistakes, and it’s heartbreaking as somebody who knows the mistakes and has seen it,” the history teacher said. Espy’s TikTok, which was posted on Tuesday, has almost 900,000 views. “These need to be pulled off the shelf,” she said in the video. A company called Bendon, which makes activity books, toys and craft kits, published the book. Target, along with Amazon, Dollar General and Walmart, is one of its retail partners according to the Bendon website. CNN has reached out to Bendon for comment. Espy hasn’t heard from Target or the maker of the book but said the Minneapolis-based company did right by pulling it off shelves quickly. “I’m a teacher. If you don’t know something, I can’t blame you for what you don’t know,” Espy said. But if “I give you the information to correct it, then it’s your responsibility.” CNN’s Parija Kavilanz contributed to this report.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/business/target-pulls-black-history-item-that-mixed-up-civil-rights-leaders/index.html,many target trip nevada u history teacher tierra espy left store item intended buy sunday added magnetic activity book iconic civil right leader cart time black history month told cnn phone interview target pulling item shelf viral tiktok espy pointed inaccuracy misidentifying name picture iconic civil right leader minneapolis startribune first reported news activity book mixed name image carter g woodson pioneer study africanamerican history web du bois sociologist historian author activist booker washington educator intellectual first president tuskegee university statement friday target said “ longer selling product store online ’ also ensured product ’ publisher aware error ” misidentifying black people people color play racist trope suggesting nonwhite people look alike trope often used dehumanize nonwhite people blunder like happened last year decorated olympian simone bile called wall street journal article published featured photo different black gymnast civil right leader book available target ’ dollar spot section espy said prominent display front store item priced one five magnetic book displayed next educational item black history month monday night espy opened book put magnet fridge child “ soon saw mistake ’ like ‘ oh ’ put ’ ” told cnn “ ’ expecting u notice mistake ’ heartbreaking somebody know mistake seen ” history teacher said espy ’ tiktok posted tuesday almost nine hundred thousand view “ need pulled shelf ” said video company called bendon make activity book toy craft kit published book target along amazon dollar general walmart one retail partner according bendon website cnn reached bendon comment espy ’ heard target maker book said minneapolisbased company right pulling shelf quickly “ ’ teacher ’ know something ’ blame ’ know ” espy said “ give information correct ’ responsibility ” cnn ’ parija kavilanz contributed report,8
2,South Carolina Democratic primary,"South Carolina, the state that launched Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination four years ago, will deliver the president his first official primary victory of the 2024 campaign on Saturday, CNN projects. In a result that was largely expected, Biden will defeat his two nearest challengers, Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips and author Marianne Williamson, as he claims his first delegates in his quest to win his party’s nomination again. Biden won all 55 delegates at stake in the South Carolina primary. This year marks the first time South Carolina has appeared at the front of the official Democratic nominating calendar — a change made largely due to Biden’s urging. Biden, who was in Los Angeles for a fundraising event Saturday evening when his win was projected, said in a statement that South Carolina put him on a path toward victory. “In 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the Presidency,” he said. “Now in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again — and making Donald Trump a loser — again.” For decades, Iowa and New Hampshire had cast the first votes in Democratic presidential primary battles. But the Democratic National Committee decided to move those states back in the calendar in the face of criticism that their largely White electorates didn’t reflect a Democratic base that is much more diverse nationally. Iowa Democratic officials accepted the changes, opting to hold a mail-in caucus with ballots sent to voters starting January 12 and due to be postmarked back by March 5 — Super Tuesday, when more than a dozen other states are scheduled to hold their primaries. New Hampshire officials, citing a state law requiring that its primary be the nation’s first, pushed back — holding a rogue Democratic contest alongside the Republican primary on January 23. However, the Democratic National Committee punished the Granite State by stripping it of delegates to the party’s 2024 convention. Because the state did not comply with the calendar the DNC had set, Biden didn’t file to appear on the state’s primary ballot. But loyalists of the president launched a successful write-in campaign on his behalf that saw him take 64% of the vote. To cement South Carolina’s status as the first primary of the 2024 Democratic race, Biden visited the Palmetto State twice last month, and Vice President Kamala Harris headlined a get-out-the-vote event at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg on Friday. “You’ve had my back, and I hope I’ve had yours,” Biden told the Sunday lunch crowd at Brookland Baptist Church in Columbia last weekend. The president wasn’t in South Carolina on Saturday, as he headed for a fundraising swing through Southern California and Nevada. Before his departure, he made a stop at his reelection campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, giving brief remarks with an eye toward the general election. “This is not just a campaign. This is more of a mission. We cannot, we cannot, we cannot lose this campaign, for the good of the country,” Biden said. “I mean that from the bottom of my heart. It’s not about me,” he said. “It’s about the country. And I think everybody knows it and I think it’s beginning to dawn on people.” “The American people get it. They understand what’s going on,” Biden said, framing the contest around the protection of democracy. With Biden facing little serious competition for the Democratic nomination, Saturday’s primary was important for the president nonetheless because it marked a return to the place that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination in 2020. Biden limped into the South Carolina primary that year after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses, fourth in the New Hampshire primary and a distant second in the Nevada caucuses. However, the Palmetto State’s large Black population — and a late endorsement from influential Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn — helped deliver Biden a dominant victory that, for the first time, demonstrated strength with a core Democratic constituency that no other primary contender could rival. Days later, Biden moved closer to clinching the party’s nomination by racking up a virtually insurmountable delegate lead across a wide swath of diverse states on Super Tuesday. South Carolina is dominated by Republicans in general elections. The last Democratic presidential nominee to win the state was Jimmy Carter in 1976. But the push by the Biden campaign and its allies in South Carolina was part of a broader effort to shore up support with Black voters, a bloc crucial to the president’s reelection prospects, particularly in battleground states such as Georgia and the “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The Democratic primary took place three weeks before Republicans will vote on February 24. The GOP primary could be former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s last chance to slow former President Donald Trump’s march to a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination. But a recent Monmouth University-Washington Post poll showed her trailing Trump by 26 points in her home-state primary. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments.

3,Wellness influencers and climate change,"In travel news this week: Flight attendants are fed up with unruly airplane passenger behavior, the world’s largest cruise ship sets sail, and Lonely Planet is coming out with a new guide to the world’s most incredible beaches. Touching grass is great, but when it comes to reconnecting with nature, one of the finest ways has to be feeling the sand between your toes. Travel behemoth Lonely Planet’s new guide to the world’s “Best Beaches” includes blockbuster spots such as Rio de Janeiro’s Ipanema and Thailand’s Ao Maya, as well as private resort paradises such as Zanzibar’s Mnemba Island. Go early in the morning to enjoy the blinding volcanic splendor of Sarakiniko in Greece. At the end of the day, sunsets over the Baltic Sea are particularly delightful at Dueodde, on the Danish island of Bornholm. Cabo San Juan del Guía on Colombia’s Caribbean coast is worth the two-hour hike to get there, says Lonely Planet, while the ferry ride required to Anse Source d’Argent in the Seychelles is part of the fun. Guys, some of you aren’t hearing right. They’re flight attendants, not fight attendants, and they are sick and tired of unruly passenger behavior. This week’s story of a passenger showing “indications of intoxication” being restrained on a JetBlue flight points to this widespread malaise. There have been customers sliding down the evacuation slide, hitting and biting flight attendants and forcing aircraft to divert from their intended destination, and it’s time to change the tide. Smart travelers are mindful of bad behavior after getting off the plane, too.

The Japanese yen has been falling in value against other currencies, which means that it’s a good time to plan your dream vacation to the Land of the Rising Sun. And while you’ll want to get Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka off your bucket list, there are some lesser-known spots that are well worth a visit, too. San’in is Japan’s least populated region but is home to some of its finest treasures. The high-speed rail system doesn’t reach here, but those who make the effort will be rewarded with 5,500 square miles of organic farmland, ancient artistic cultures and historic islands with unique ecologies. In Hiroshima prefecture, Tomonoura is a quiet coastal village where you can also escape the crowds. The Japanese know it as the filming location for Marvel’s “The Wolverine,” as well as the inspiration for Studio Ghibli’s animated “Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea.” The world’s largest cruise ship, all 1,200 feet and 250,800 gross tons of her, set out from the Port of Miami on its maiden cruise. The buzz around the $2 billion Icon of the Seas has been huge — but not everyone is impressed. The longest cruise in terms of duration might set sail in May, if Villa Vie Residences’ three-and-a-half-year journey goes according to plan. The precedent set has not been good — Life at Sea’s dream of a three-year cruise spectacularly fell apart last year. Tensions in the Red Sea are disrupting cruise voyages, with Royal Caribbean, Carnival Corporation and MSC Cruise among those adjusting their itineraries. And finally, nearly 140 people on a three-week leg of a Cunard Cruise Line voyage got sick with gastrointestinal illness at the end of January.

4,‘Arctic Ascent’,"President Joe Biden will skip a pre-Super Bowl interview for the second year in a row — and his aides argue that it’s part of their larger plan, not a move to avoid having the president answer questions in front of the whole country. Biden advisers tell CNN they see skipping the interview, which would have aired as a segment of the pregame show and not during peak viewing hours on the CBS broadcast, as a strategic decision to give Americans a break from the politics of the 2024 campaign. Advisers say they’re seeing people already expressing fatigue with election news and want to avoid piling on. The decision was made ahead of last week’s right-wing media explosion about Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, tight end Travis Kelce, after he and the Kansas City Chiefs made it to the Super Bowl, where they’ll face the San Francisco 49ers. MAGA media personalities have been circulating conspiracy theories about the pop superstar, promoting the notion that she is part of a sprawling psychological operations plot staged by the NFL and Democratic Party to deliver the 2024 presidential election to Biden. The pregame presidential interview is a relatively young tradition, stretching back only to Barack Obama’s first year in office, and one that Donald Trump skipped once himself. But for Biden, who for months has been complaining in public and in conversations with top advisers that messaging touting his achievements isn’t breaking through to the public, the decision means skipping out on an audience of millions — including many who might not otherwise be paying attention to presidential politics. It’s also the latest instance of Biden opting against a high-profile interview with a large audience. That has become a constant source of irritation for the White House press corps, but has also fed questions of whether he is up to doing them. In response, Biden advisers often point to the many times each week the president takes questions from reporters as he is headed across the White House South Lawn to board Marine One, or interviews like those he did on local radio this past week ahead of Saturday’s South Carolina Democratic primary. Biden advisers say that there are no concerns about insulating the president, and that it wasn’t part of the decision on this interview. On Saturday, Biden argued there is more than regular politics to the 2024 race, saying in remarks at his Wilmington, Delaware, campaign headquarters, “This is not just a campaign. This is more of a mission. We cannot, we cannot, we cannot lose this campaign, for the good of the country.” “I think everybody knows it and I think it’s beginning to dawn on people,” Biden added. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other top Democrats have argued the president’s consistently low poll numbers are largely the result of Americans not knowing enough about him and his record, and that they have to do more to break through. Not next Sunday, though. “We hope viewers enjoy watching what they tuned in for — the game,” White House communications director Ben LaBolt told CNN. Biden did sit for a Super Bowl interview shortly after taking office in 2021, and the campaign didn’t start this season viewing football as sacrosanct time. A Biden ad touting his success at improving the economy was placed on local stations and national cable during the season opener between the Chiefs and Detroit Lions in September, and more were run for the Lions-Green Bay Packers game on Thanksgiving. The campaign argued at the time that it was a chance to appeal to big audiences in those two swing states. In past years, the Super Bowl presidential interviews often drove news coverage for days. But the Biden White House has always been skeptical of the value of doing so, in part due to anxiety that a flub could become an unwanted distraction. Biden’s last major interview was on comedian Conan O’Brien’s podcast, recorded at the White House in December.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/president-biden-super-bowl-interview/index.html,president joe biden skip presuper bowl interview second year row — aide argue ’ part larger plan move avoid president answer question front whole country biden adviser tell cnn see skipping interview would aired segment pregame show peak viewing hour cbs broadcast strategic decision give american break politics two thousand and twenty-four campaign adviser say ’ seeing people already expressing fatigue election news want avoid piling decision made ahead last week ’ rightwing medium explosion taylor swift boyfriend tight end travis kelce kansa city chief made super bowl ’ face san francisco 49ers maga medium personality circulating conspiracy theory pop superstar promoting notion part sprawling psychological operation plot staged nfl democratic party deliver two thousand and twenty-four presidential election biden pregame presidential interview relatively young tradition stretching back barack obama ’ first year office one donald trump skipped biden month complaining public conversation top adviser messaging touting achievement ’ breaking public decision mean skipping audience million — including many might otherwise paying attention presidential politics ’ also latest instance biden opting highprofile interview large audience become constant source irritation white house press corp also fed question whether response biden adviser often point many time week president take question reporter headed across white house south lawn board marine one interview like local radio past week ahead saturday ’ south carolina democratic primary biden adviser say concern insulating president ’ part decision interview saturday biden argued regular politics two thousand and twenty-four race saying remark wilmington delaware campaign headquarters “ campaign mission lose campaign good country ” “ think everybody know think ’ beginning dawn people ” biden added biden vice president kamala harris top democrat argued president ’ consistently low poll number largely result american knowing enough record break next sunday though “ hope viewer enjoy watching tuned — game ” white house communication director ben labolt told cnn biden sit super bowl interview shortly taking office two thousand and twenty-one campaign ’ start season viewing football sacrosanct time biden ad touting success improving economy placed local station national cable season opener chief detroit lion september run lionsgreen bay packer game thanksgiving campaign argued time chance appeal big audience two swing state past year super bowl presidential interview often drove news coverage day biden white house always skeptical value part due anxiety flub could become unwanted distraction biden ’ last major interview comedian conan ’ brien ’ podcast recorded white house december,5
5,Spying pigeon,"The US will take “further action” after conducting major airstrikes over the weekend against Iranian-backed militias who have carried out attacks on US troops in the Middle East, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. “I would just say that the president was clear when he ordered them and when he conducted them that that was the beginning of our response and there will be more steps to come,” Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Sullivan, in response to Bash asking whether that meant the US was planning additional strikes, said, “What it means is that we will take further action. “I’m not going to, obviously, describe the character of that action because I don’t want to telegraph our punches,” he said. Sullivan’s comments comes after the US has adopted a “multi-tiered” response to the drone attack that killed three US service members and wounded more than 40 others last week. The attack brought the worst loss of US military life in the region in nearly three years and the first US military fatalities since the war in Gaza erupted. On Friday, the US hit 85 targets across seven locations in Iraq and Syria, a significant escalation in tensions between the US and Iran-backed groups attacking American bases across the region in protest of Israel’s war in Gaza. Believed to be funded and trained by Iran, these groups view the US as responsible for Israel’s actions by supplying weapons to the Jewish state and failing to force a ceasefire. The US strikes killed at least 16 people in Iraq, including civilians, and injured 25 others, the Iraqi government said Friday. The attacks hit areas close to the border with Syria and targeted facilities used by Iranian-linked al Hashd al Shabi — or Popular Mobilization Units — in the Iraqi city of Al-Qaim, Iraqi officials said. The US is “still assessing the battle damage” from Friday night’s strikes in Iraq and Syria, Sullivan said, and “our CENTCOM, Central Command, is looking at the capabilities we reduced and the casualties that were incurred.” CNN cannot independently verify the number or nature of the casualties. The next day, the US and UK conducted strikes on at least 30 Houthi targets in Yemen from air and surface platforms, including fighter jets, with the support of several other countries. Saturday’s strikes specifically targeted Houthi weapons storage facilities and equipment. The Houthis responded by saying they will not stop until Israel ends its operations in Gaza. As to whether the US is now embroiled in a regional conflict, Sullivan maintained that the Iran-backed militia attacks on US forces in Iraq and Syria are separate from the Houthi strikes on Red Sea shipping, calling them “distinct but related challenges.” But he said that Tehran is at the center of most of it. “Iran has a significant and pernicious responsibility for much of the instability in the Middle East,” he said. “And that has to be factored into how we approach everything that we’re doing and how Israel has to approach everything it’s doing.” The Biden administration is threading a needle – it wants to deter and stop further attacks but avoid a full-scale conflict with Iran in a region already roiled by the continuing Israel-Hamas war. “We are not looking to take the United States to war,” Sullivan said. “So we are going to continue to pursue a policy that goes down both of those lines simultaneously, that responds with force and clarity, as we did on Friday night, but also that continues to hew to an approach that does not get the United States pulled into a war that we have seen too frequently in the Middle East.” Asked whether the US would rule out strikes inside Iran, Sullivan said he is “not going to rule in and rule out any activity anywhere,” but that “the president will do what he thinks needs to be done.” A senior administration official previously confirmed to CNN that the US will not attack on Iranian soil and will focus only on targets outside of the country. Tehran has repeatedly said it does not seek conflict.

6,Terrifying ocean crossing,"The Sovereign Military Order of Malta – also known as the Knights of Malta – isn’t just a religious Catholic order with nearly 1,000 years of history. Nor is it just a multi-million-dollar-budget humanitarian aid organization, with operations including refugee camps and disaster relief programs in some 120 countries around the world. It’s also a sovereign nation, with United Nations observer status and its own constitution, but, unusually, without any land. It issues car license plates – without having any roads to drive them on – and its own stamps, currency and passports. The Knights originated as a chivalric order in Jerusalem around 1099 and were gifted the Maltese archipelago in 1530 by the King of Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte forced the Knights out of Malta in the French invasion of 1798, and these days the Order is headquartered in Rome. Daniel de Petri Testaferrata, the Malta-based President of the Order, tells CNN that only about 100 of the 13,500 knights, dames and chaplains now dispersed around the globe live in the Maltese archipelago. The first passports were issued by the Order of Malta in the 1300s when its diplomats traveled to other states with documents attesting to their role as ambassadors. After World War II, the use of the diplomatic passport took on characteristics of passports used in other countries. Today, there are only around 500 of the diplomatic passports in circulation – making it the rarest passport in the world. The Order’s crimson passport (perhaps a nod to the blood of Christ) is reserved for members of the Sovereign Council and leaders of diplomatic missions and their families. It’s adorned with gold lettering stating the organization’s name in French, “Ordre Souverain Militaire de Malte,” and a crest. “The Order grants passports to members of their government for the duration of their mandate,” de Petri Testaferrata says. Grand Masters’ passports are valid for the longest period as they’re elected for 10 years, can serve two terms, and must retire by 85. Other passports are valid for four years and are only used for diplomatic missions. The passports have 44 pages watermarked with the Maltese cross without much other fanfare – no images or quotes. Eugenio Ajroldi di Robbiate, the Order’s former communications director, tells CNN that it can be funny to see the reaction of customs officers when they see the passport. “They’ve likely never seen one before. Once when I arrived at the Bangkok airport, a crowd of operators at passport control wanted to see my rare passport and take a selfie with it,” says Ajroldi di Robbiate. According to De Petri Testaferrata, two-thirds of Schengen members recognize the diplomatic passport and the Order works closely with many countries with no formal diplomatic relations such as France, the United Kingdom and the United States. “We provide rapid medical and humanitarian supplies to victims of conflict or natural disasters. We run hospitals, ambulance corps, medical centers, homes for the elderly and the disabled, soup kitchens and first aid posts,” de Petri Testaferrata explains. While you’re unlikely to run into any Knights on a visit to Malta, there are many places across the Maltese Islands to learn about the fight and fate of the storied Order. One of the first things you’ll notice as you arrive on the main island is the massive honey-hued Fort St. Angelo jutting out of the azure waters of the Grand Harbor. The imposing medieval bastion was once the Order’s Headquarters and is the only remaining structure on the island that still partly belongs to the Knights. De Petri Testaferrata tells CNN the chapel dedicated to St. Anne in the upper part of the Fort is still cared for by the Order. You can tour this part of the fort to see where the Grand Master de Valette prayed daily for deliverance from the Ottoman invaders during the Great Siege of 1565. Inside the ancient bastion walls of Mdina, Malta’s medieval capital and a UNESCO World Heritage site, you can learn more about the Order at “The Knights of Malta” 3D audiovisual show. It’s located in the Casa Magazzini where the Knights once stored ammunition and tells the Knights’ history in Malta, including when they were gifted the archipelago in 1530 by the King of Spain. In the capital city of Valletta, you can continue your Knight trail at the National Library of Malta where the Pie Postulatio Voluntatis, the parchment Pope Paschal II used in 1113 to grant the Order sovereignty, is housed. “The library’s collection consists of original documents and manuscripts of the Order,” Dane Munro, a tour guide and historian specializing in the history of the Order, says. After the library, you can head across the street to the Grand Master’s Palace which once hosted the Knights. The Throne Room was used by the Knights as the Hall of the Supreme Council and remains adorned with ancient frescoes depicting the Great Siege. Don’t miss the portraits of Grand Masters in the Hall of Ambassadors. Like all good chivalrous gentlemen, the Knights loved fine art, leading to a controversy. Renowned Italian painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio arrived in Malta in 1607 after killing a man in a duel and fleeing Rome. The Order made him a Knight and he became the court painter. Shortly after Caravaggio showcased he was more of a brawler than a gentleman and the Knights expelled him from the Order. While visiting St John’s Co-Cathedral, just a few blocks from the Grand Master’s Palace, keep an eye out for “The Beheading of St John” which is Caravaggio’s largest and only known signed work. A few blocks away is the Casa Rocca Piccola of the de Piro family who were closely involved with the Order, according to Munro. You can take a tour of the grand home where Marquis Nicholas de Piro, the Chancellor of the Maltese Association of the Order, lives. His home is a time capsule of 16th-century Baroque elegance. You can also stay in a palazzo that belonged to the Knights. Rosselli AX Privilege is a boutique hotel housed in the 17th-century home of Knight of Malta Don Pietro Rosselli and is centrally located in Valletta, making it the perfect home base as you tour around Malta to learn about the Knights. If you get lucky and spot one of the few Knights on the archipelago, you might be able to identify them from their traditional robes, which are only worn during religious ceremonies. The black tunic with white cuffs features the eight-pointed Maltese cross. An additional decoration around the neck depicts the Knight’s rank in the Order of Malta.

7,"Israeli soldiers struggle with the realities of the war in Gaza. As the death toll mounts, some are calling for a new government. Others say fighting is the only option.","Closed to tourists until recently, Saudi Arabia is still an unknown quantity for many would-be travelers. That’s changing fast. The country reported a 56% growth in international arrivals in 2023 from 2019 pre-pandemic levels, according to the UNWTO. So, where are some of the best places in this emerging tourism destination to go? We asked some of the people who know it best – regular visitors and Saudis themselves. From celebrities to rocket scientists, here’s what they recommend: This living museum is best known for historic dwellings dating back thousands of years, dramatic rock formations and some of Saudi’s most spectacular scenery. Lojain Omran, a Saudi television presenter and star of Netflix’s UAE-based reality show “Dubai Bling,” is a fan. “It’s like nowhere else on Earth, it is truly magical,” she tells CNN. Like everyone interviewed for this feature, she was speaking via email. “The level of peace and comfort in AlUla is just unmatched. If you are into meditation and relaxation, AlUla is the perfect spot. It is secluded, far from the hustle and bustle of crowds and city noise.” Omran, who is also an actress, says when visiting she stays at A-list favorite the Banyan Tree AlUla, which features private tented villas. “It combines luxury, privacy, and tranquillity, in addition to excellent service for all guests,” she says. Omran is also hopeful visitors will explore destinations across Saudi Arabia. “The Kingdom is vast, and every region has its unique charm in terms of nature, atmosphere, cuisine, customs, and traditions, adding a wealth of cultural richness to our experiences,” she says. A highlight of any visit to Saudi’s second-largest city is a wander through the winding alleys of its historic Al Balad district, where ancient coral stone and wooden buildings come with fascinating stories. Established in the 7th century, Al Balad was once the beating heart of Jeddah, and is still a top destination. Mai Eldib, a senior vice president for auction house Sotheby’s in the Middle East, says she has witnessed transformative changes in Saudi Arabia over the last eight years, and always makes a beeline for this fascinating area when she’s in town. “The beauty of the old town is that it is almost stuck in time and tells the story of Jeddah as a port city – a true melting pot, as so many people making the pilgrimage to Hajj stopped and made a life and a home there,” says Eldib. “There is a huge preservation effort from the government, restoring the 18th and 19th century Ottoman houses, and it is wonderful to see the old neighborhoods coming to life and being renewed.” Eldib particularly recommends Jeddah’s Angawi House. “My jaw dropped when I first saw this sumptuous private home as it’s a real kaleidoscope of colors, craftsmanship, history and modernity,” she says. “It’s not to be missed as a mesmerizing introduction to Saudi’s past and present.” “You can’t talk about islands in Saudi Arabia without talking about a new tourist favorite, but a treasured local one, Al Nawras Island,” Saudi professional boxer Ziyad Almaayouf tells CNN. “Personally, I love to jump on a rented boat or a friend’s yacht and go to Al Nawras Island as much as I can, and I would recommend any tourist do the same!” Ziyad, who is based in California, says he enjoys the tranquility of the island, located on the Red Sea coast north of Jeddah. “What I love most about Al Nawras Island, isn’t the island itself, but the waters surrounding it,” he adds. “Park the yacht just before the island to enjoy the scenes and the water for the day, it truly is a piece of heaven and a true hidden gem.” When he’s away training, Ziyad says he pines for traditional Saudi culture and home comforts. “I miss dinner with my whole family – parents, grandparents, siblings, and cousins. We all join one table as it’s a symbol of togetherness,” he says. “And I miss the bonus life hack and cultural tradition of eating with our hands. Believe it or not, eating with your hands takes the food time experience to a whole other level. I love it.” Saudi aerospace engineer Mishaal Ashemimry, says she is still in awe of the wonderful desert sand dunes around Unaizah, a small city northwest of capital Riyadh, which she credits for inspiring her passion for space when she was six. “My mom took me to the desert dunes on our farm in Unaizah at night,” she says. “The sky was so dark and all you could see was the light from the stars above. Back then there wasn’t much light pollution, as such, all you see is a thick layer of stars and it was captivating. “Looking up to the sky that night changed my life, as it set the course of my future to become an aerospace engineer to enable me to explore space and learn more about the stars and our mysterious universe.” Now founder and CEO of MISHAAL Aerospace, Mishaal still visits her childhood haunt and proudly champions her heritage through her work. “As an Arab, exploration is part of my DNA and seeking knowledge to better our understanding of the cosmos is the ultimate goal,” she says. Mishaal says she is just as excited to discover more about her vast homeland too. “One of my goals is to fly a twin-engine aeroplane around Saudi to explore all its cities.” Riyadh-born singer Tamtam went viral around the globe in 2014 with her song “Gender Game,” which contains powerful lyrics about the challenges facing Saudi women. She may be one of Saudi’s hottest cultural exports, but Tamtam, AKA Reem Altamimi, says she loves the buzz of being back in her homeland and visiting much-loved haunts, including the historic Souk Al Zal, in Riyadh’s Al Dirah district. “It may be a typical place to take tourists in Riyadh, but Souk Al Zal is honestly a favorite of mine as it’s one of the oldest traditional markets in the city,” she tells CNN. With over 100 years of history in its ancient-tiled walkways, the traditional market is known for tiny shops filled with incense and oud, as well as its daily antiques auction. “It’s close to Masmak Fort too, another must-see in the city,” the Los Angeles-based singer says, referring to a renovated 19th-century mudbrick fortress. Lured in by the rich smell of Ethiopian coffee beans and freshly baked brownies, Tamtam is a loyal patron of one of Riyadh’s most popular coffee spots, Ba’a Bakehouse. “It’s locally owned, really unique for a coffee shop in the city and I love the location,” she says. Established in the 15th century, Diriyah is the original home of the country’s royal family. The historic, mudbrick-built site is currently being developed into what Saudi officials say will be a $63 billion cultural and lifestyle center that will draw in 27 million visitors a year. Hatem Alakeel, the Saudi founder of luxury consulting and creative production agency Authenticite, says Diriyah, west of Riyadh, is already worth a visit. “Diriyah is the birthplace of the kingdom and a symbol of the unity, beauty and resilience of the Saudi nation and its people,” he says. “Deemed the land of kings and heroes due to its historical significance, it has been carefully restored to offer visitors a chance to tread in the footsteps of generations past and experience Saudi history and culture in an authentic environment.” With breathtaking beaches, stunning coral reefs and crystal-clear turquoise waters, Umluj is a stark contrast to Saudi’s infamous desert landscapes. The resort on the Red Sea coast is often promoted as “the Maldives of Saudi Arabia,” offering water sports and cultural experiences. “This secluded coastal area is a haven of natural beauty, providing a serene escape from the hustle and bustle,” says Saudi American Tasneem Alsultan, a documentary photographer. “Its pristine beaches and azure waters make it a hidden paradise for those seeking tranquility.” Tasneem, who has spent recent years documenting social changes in Saudi Arabia, adds: “Saudi Arabia’s allure lies in its unique blend of tradition, generosity, and captivating stories waiting to be discovered. “Our society is a tapestry of generosity, rich Arab traditions, and a profound commitment to storytelling in its myriad forms. The warmth of our people, the depth of our cultural heritage, and the vibrant narratives woven into every aspect of life make Saudi Arabia an exceptional destination.”",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/best-things-to-experience-in-saudi-arabia/index.html,closed tourist recently saudi arabia still unknown quantity many wouldbe traveler ’ changing fast

8,"US strikes Houthi anti-ship and land attack cruise missiles, Central Command says","Samsung chief Lee Jae-yong was found not guilty by a Seoul court on Monday on charges of stock manipulation and accounting fraud connected to a controversial merger in 2015 of two Samsung affiliates. The acquittal comes as a major relief to the chairman of Samsung Electronics, who has been embroiled in legal problems for years. Last year, South Korean prosecutors had asked for a five-year jail term for Lee, alleging that he and other executives inflated the stock price of a textile company, Cheil Industries, and devalued a construction and engineering company, Samsung C&T. They alleged that the merger of the two firms allowed Lee to gain a tighter grip on Samsung Electronics, the group’s flagship company. Lee’s attorneys had denied any wrongdoing, saying the merger had helped the management of the conglomerate became more stable. Seoul Central District Court chief judge Park Jeong-je said there was not enough evidence that Samsung had intended to cause losses to Samsung C&T and its shareholders through the merger. “Even if Lee’s control has been strengthened, the merger in this case cannot be considered unfair, as long as there is a reasonable purpose for the merger,” Park said. It’s unclear if prosecutors will appeal this ruling, which has come as a surprise to experts. “It is a totally shocking verdict,” Park Sangin, economics professor at Seoul National University, told CNN. He added the decision will “lead to lowering the confidence of foreign investors in the Korean legal system and the soundness of the Korean capital market.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/05/business/south-korea-samsung-jy-lee-acquittal-intl-hnk/index.html,samsung chief lee jaeyong found guilty seoul court monday charge stock manipulation accounting fraud connected controversial merger two thousand and fifteen two samsung affiliate acquittal come major relief chairman samsung electronics embroiled legal problem year last year south korean prosecutor asked fiveyear jail term lee alleging executive inflated stock price textile company cheil industry devalued construction engineering company samsung ct alleged merger two firm allowed lee gain tighter grip samsung electronics group ’ flagship company lee ’ attorney denied wrongdoing saying merger helped management conglomerate became stable seoul central district court chief judge park jeongje said enough evidence samsung intended cause loss samsung ct shareholder merger “ even lee ’ control strengthened merger case considered unfair long reasonable purpose merger ” park said ’ unclear prosecutor appeal ruling come surprise expert “ totally shocking verdict ” park sangin economics professor seoul national university told cnn added decision “ lead lowering confidence foreign investor korean legal system soundness korean capital market ”,5
9,"US destroyed or damaged 84 of 85 targets in Iraq and Syria, officials say","As the President’s Office remained stum for another day over whether or not Ukraine’s commander-in-chief was out of a job, one of the men tipped possibly to replace him gave a short but clear-eyed assessment of the situation facing soldiers on the front line. Visiting troops near the town of Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region, Oleksandr Syrskyi, wrote on his Telegram channel, “The operational situation remains tense. Heavy fighting is taking place along all sectors of the frontline.” Syrskyi made no reference to reports that President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to announce the dismissal of army chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi over disagreements about what Ukraine should do to win the war following the failure of the counteroffensive. But Syrskyi did nod to the highly charged issue of troop numbers, and Russia’s advantage in that area, when he wrote, “The enemy continues to conduct high-intensity assault operations and is constantly bringing in new reserves.” Zelensky’s reluctance to get behind army chief Zaluzhnyi’s request for a mobilization drive of up to half a million people, made last December, is seen as a key reason for the spike in tensions between them. CNN has reported the president told Zaluzhnyi he was being replaced at a meeting last Monday. A presidential spokesman denied the report but a source familiar with the matter said an announcement was expected within days. As of Sunday morning, the army chief was still in office. Zaluzhnyi referenced his frustrations in an Opinion piece for CNN last week, referring to, “the inability of state institutions in Ukraine to improve the manpower levels of our armed forces without the use of unpopular measures.” The region visited by Syrskyi on Saturday has seen Ukrainian forces pushed back in several places over recent weeks, with Russian pressure bearing down in particular on a group of settlements clustered around the village of Tabaivka, which lies along the border of the Luhansk and Kharkiv regions. A General Staff report Saturday evening reported further air strikes as well as artillery and mortar fire launched at more than 15 settlements in the area. A senior army spokesman with responsibility for the same region drew attention to another Ukrainian deficit opposite Russia, in comments on Ukrainian television – namely, a lack of ammunition. “The Russians are superior in both equipment and personnel,” Illia Yevlash said, adding: “We need a lot of ammunition to destroy such power and intensity.” However, Yevlash said Russian soldiers were also experiencing possible ammunition shortages, albeit less severe than Ukraine. Where previously, Russian forces had been firing 60,000 rounds a day along the entire front line, the number currently was about half that, he said. Yevlash also commented on the situation around the battered city of Bakhmut – which has been at the centre of fighting for over a year. Russian forces were working hard to break through Ukraine’s defenses, the spokesman said, with the aim of advancing towards Chasiv Yar, a highly militarized town on higher ground a few kilometers west of Bakhmut. An indication of the toll such relentless fighting has taken came from Oleksandr, a member of a sniper platoon working in the same area of operations. “We are in deep defense mode and are holding back the enemy. Both our men and those of the enemy are exhausted.” Further south, Russian attention has been focused for months on the town of Avdiivka, and its massive coke plant, both of which Russia has been attempting to encircle. The Deep State mapping service, widely used by analysts for its careful reporting of frontline movements, has indicated Russian gains to the north of the town in recent days, though a spokesman for the 47th brigade, which is fighting to defend the town, was more upbeat. Dmytro Lazutkin said his brigade was inflicting heavy losses on Russia, which had still been unable to break through and cut off Ukrainian logistics supplies to the town.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/europe/ukrainian-soldiers-defense-mode-zaluzhnyi-intl-hnk/index.html,president ’ office remained stum another day whether ukraine ’ commanderinchief job one men tipped possibly replace gave short cleareyed assessment situation facing soldier front line visiting troop near town kupiansk kharkiv region oleksandr syrskyi wrote telegram channel “ operational situation remains tense heavy fighting taking place along sector frontline ” syrskyi made reference report president volodymyr zelensky set announce dismissal army chief valerii zaluzhnyi disagreement ukraine win war following failure counteroffensive syrskyi nod highly charged issue troop number russia ’ advantage area wrote “ enemy continues conduct highintensity assault operation constantly bringing new reserve ” zelensky ’ reluctance get behind army chief zaluzhnyi ’ request mobilization drive half million people made last december seen key reason spike tension cnn reported president told zaluzhnyi replaced meeting last monday presidential spokesman denied report source familiar matter said announcement expected within day sunday morning army chief still office zaluzhnyi referenced frustration opinion piece cnn last week referring “ inability state institution ukraine improve manpower level armed force without use unpopular measure ” region visited syrskyi saturday seen ukrainian force pushed back several place recent week russian pressure bearing particular group settlement clustered around village tabaivka lie along border luhansk kharkiv region general staff report saturday evening reported air strike well artillery mortar fire launched fifteen settlement area senior army spokesman responsibility region drew attention another ukrainian deficit opposite russia comment ukrainian television – namely lack ammunition “ russian superior equipment personnel ” illia yevlash said adding “ need lot ammunition destroy power intensity ” however yevlash said russian soldier also experiencing possible ammunition shortage albeit le severe ukraine previously russian force firing sixty thousand round day along entire front line number currently half said yevlash also commented situation around battered city bakhmut – centre fighting year russian force working hard break ukraine ’ defense spokesman said aim advancing towards chasiv yar highly militarized town higher ground kilometer west bakhmut indication toll relentless fighting taken came oleksandr member sniper platoon working area operation “ deep defense mode holding back enemy men enemy exhausted ” south russian attention focused month town avdiivka massive coke plant russia attempting encircle deep state mapping service widely used analyst careful reporting frontline movement indicated russian gain north town recent day though spokesman 47th brigade fighting defend town upbeat dmytro lazutkin said brigade inflicting heavy loss russia still unable break cut ukrainian logistics supply town,7
10,Video shows ultra-Orthodox man spitting at Christian priest in Jerusalem,"It’s the body of water that instils fear and inspires sailors in equal measure. Six hundred miles of open sea, and some of the roughest conditions on the planet – with an equally inhospitable land of snow and ice awaiting you at the end of it. “The most dreaded bit of ocean on the globe – and rightly so,” Alfred Lansing wrote of explorer Ernest Shackleton’s 1916 voyage across it in a small lifeboat. It is, of course, the Drake Passage, connecting the southern tip of the South American continent with the northernmost point of the Antarctic Peninsula. Once the preserve of explorers and sea dogs, the Drake is today a daunting challenge for an ever-increasing number of travelers to Antarctica – and not just because it takes up to 48 hours to cross it. For many, being able to boast of surviving the “Drake shake” is part of the attraction of going to the “white continent.” But what causes those “shakes,” which can see waves topping nearly 50 feet battering the ships? And how do sailors navigate the planet’s wildest waters? For oceanographers, it turns out, the Drake is a fascinating place because of what’s going on under the surface of those thrashing waters. And for ship captains, it’s a challenge that needs to be approached with a healthy dose of fear. At around 600 miles wide and up to 6,000 meters (nearly four miles) deep, the Drake is objectively a vast body of water. To us, that is. To the planet as a whole, less so. The Antarctic Peninsula, where tourists visit, isn’t even Antarctica proper. It’s a thinning peninsula, rotating northwards from the vast continent of Antarctica, and reaching towards the southern tip of South America – the two pointing towards each other, a bit like a tectonic version of Michelangelo’s “Creation of Adam” in the Sistine Chapel. That creates a pinch point effect, with the water being squeezed between the two land masses – the ocean is surging through the gap between the continents. “It’s the only place in the world where those winds can push all around the globe without hitting land – and land tends to dampen storms,” says oceanographer Alexander Brearley, head of open oceans at the British Antarctic Survey. Winds tend to blow west to east, he says – and the latitudes of 40 to 60 are notorious for strong winds. Hence their nicknames of the “roaring forties,” “furious fifties” and “screaming sixties” (Antarctica officially starts at 60 degrees). But winds are slowed by landmass – which is why Atlantic storms tend to smash into Ireland and the UK (as they did, causing havoc, with Storm Isha in January buffeting planes to entirely different countries) and then weaken as they continue east to the European continent. With no land to slow them down at the Drake’s latitude anywhere on the planet, winds can hurtle around the globe, gathering pace – and smashing into ships. “In the middle of the Drake Passage the winds may have blown over thousands of kilometers to where you are,” says Brearley. “Kinetic energy is converted from wind into waves, and builds up storm waves.” Those can reach up to 15 meters, or 49 feet, he says. Although before you get too alarmed, know that the mean wave height on the Drake is rather less – four to five meters, or 13-16 feet. That’s still double what you’ll find in the Atlantic, by way of comparison. And it’s not just the winds making the waters rough – the Drake is basically one big surge of water. “The Southern Ocean is very stormy in general [but] in the Drake you’re really squeezing [the water] between the Antarctic and the southern hemisphere,” he adds. “That intensifies the storms as they come through.” He calls it a “funneling effect.” Then there’s the speed at which the water is thrashing through. The Drake is part of the most voluminous ocean current in the world, with up to 5,300 million cubic feet flowing per second. Squeezed into the narrow passage, the current increases, traveling west to east. Brearley says that at surface level, that current is less perceptible – just a couple of knots – so you won’t really sense it onboard. “But it does mean you’ll travel a bit more slowly,” he says. For oceanographers, he says, the Drake is “a fascinating place.” It’s home to what he calls “underwater mountains” below the surface – and the enormous current squeezing through the (relatively) narrow passage causes waves to break against them underwater. These “internal waves,” as he calls them, create vortices which bring colder water from the depths of the ocean higher up – important for the planet’s climate. “It’s not just turbulent at the surface, though obviously that’s what you feel the most – but it’s actually turbulent all the way through the water column,” says Brearley, who regularly crosses the Drake on a research ship. Does he get scared? “I don’t think I’ve ever been really fearful, but it can be very unpleasant in terms of how rough it is,” he says candidly. One other key thing that makes the Drake so scary: our fear of the Drake itself. Brearley points out that until the Panama Canal opened in 1914, ships going from Europe to the west coast of the Americas had to dip round Cape Horn – the southern tip of South America – and then trundle up the Pacific coast. “Let’s say you were shipping goods from western Europe to California. You either had to offload them in New York and do the journey across the US, or you had to go all the way around,” he says. It wasn’t just large cargo ships, either; passenger ships made the same route. There’s even a monument at the tip of Cape Horn, in memorial of the more than 10,000 sailors who are believed to have died traveling through. “The routes between the south of South Africa and Australia, or Australia or New Zealand to Antarctica, don’t really lie on any major shipping routes,” says Brearley. “The reason it’s been so feared over the centuries is because the Drake is where ships really have to go. Other parts [of the Southern Ocean] can be avoided.” Navigating the Drake is an extremely complex task that demands humility and a side of fear, says Captain Stanislas Devorsine, one of three captains of Le Commandant Charcot, a polar vessel of adventure cruise company Ponant. “You have to have a healthy fear,” he says of the Drake. “It’s something that keeps you focused, alert, sensitive to the ship and the weather. You need to be aware that it can be dangerous – that it’s never routine.” Devorsine made his Drake debut as a captain over 20 years ago, sailing an icebreaker full of scientists over to Antarctica for a research stint. “We had very, very rough seas – more than 20 meter [66 feet] swells,” he says. “It was very windy, very rough.” Not that Ponant’s clients face anything like that. Devorsine is quick to point out that the comfort levels for a research ship – and the conditions it will sail in – are very different from those for a cruise. “We are extremely cautious – the ocean is stronger than us,” he says. “We’re not able to go in terrible weather. We go in rough seas but always with a big safety margin. We’re not gambling.” Even with that extra safety margin, though, he admits that crossing the Drake can be a hairy experience. “It can be very rough and very dangerous, so we take special care,” he says. “We have to choose the best time to cross the Drake. We have to adapt our course – sometimes we don’t head in our final direction, we alter the course to have a better angle with the waves. We might slow down to leave a low pressure path ahead, or speed up to pass one before it arrives.” Of course, every time you get on a ship – whether it’s a simple ferry ride or a fancy cruise – the crew will already have meticulously planned the journey, checking everything from the weather to the tides and currents. But planning for a crossing of the Drake is on a whole new level. Weather forecasting has improved in the two decades since Devorsine’s first ride, he says – and these days crew start planning the voyage while passengers are making their way to South America from all over the globe. Sometimes they leave late; sometimes they head back early, to beat bad weather. Devorsine – who makes the return journey about six to eight times per year – estimates that the unusually calm “Drake lake” effect happens once in every 10 crossings, with particularly rough conditions (that “Drake shake”) once or twice in every 10 journeys. Of course, he knows what’s in store long before the passengers reach the ship. “We look ahead to have the best option to cross. Normally I look at the weather 10 days or a week before, just to have an idea of what it could be,” he says. “Then I check the forecast once per day, then two or three days before departure I start looking at it twice per day. If it’s going to be a challenging passage you look every six hours. If you have to adjust your departure time, then you look at it very closely to be very accurate.” His safety margin means that he’s calculating a route that will get you across not just alive, but also as comfortably as possible. Hearing an anecdote about broken crockery and furniture on another operator, he sighs, “That’s a bit too far for me.” “Before you have any issue with a storm, you have to keep a comfortable ship,” he says. The safety margin is to be sure that the guests will enjoy being in Antarctica, and that we won’t turn around because we have a problem… like injured people.” In extreme conditions, he orders extra weather advice from Ponant HQ, but if you’re imagining the staff on the bridge desperately radioing for advice as waves batter the ship, think again. “It would never happen to be in the middle of the Drake with bad conditions, needing assistance from headquarters because it would mean we didn’t have any safety margin before departure. When we cross and it’s going to be challenging, we have a big safety margin and the ship is not at all in danger.” They are in contact with headquarters with high level satellite antennae throughout the crossing, with both satellite and radio backup if needed – Devorsine says he can’t imagine ever losing contact, whatever the weather. Devorsine, who now spends 90% of his time sailing in polar waters, feels at home on the Drake. “When I was a little child, I read books about the maritime adventures of sailors and polar heroes,” he says. “I was attracted by tough things – I like challenges. This is why I followed the path to be able to sail in these areas.” His first experience of the area was doing a “race around the world” in a sailboat as a youngster, heading south from his native France and rounding Cape Horn. “It was my dream because it’s difficult, dangerous and challenging,” he says. He’s not the only one. Some guests are drawn to Antarctica trips because of the tough journey. “I guess [they] are attracted by these areas [of the Southern Ocean] because it’s wild, it can be rough, and it’s a unique experience to go there,” he says. Not everone’s a thrill-seeker though. As managing director of Mundy Adventures, an adventure travel agency, Edwina Lonsdale is dealing with a clientele already used to discomfort – yet she says crossing the Drake is a “conversation topic” during booking. “it’s something we would raise to make sure people are completely aware of what they’re buying,” she says. “[Going to Antarctica] is a huge investment – you need to talk through every aspect and make sure nothing’s an absolute no.” Lonsdale advises that passengers nervous of feeling sick should choose their ship carefully. In the past, vessels heading to Antarctica tended to be uncomfortable metal boxes built to take a heavy beating. But in recent years, companies have introduced more technically advanced vessels: like Le Commandant Charcot, which was the world’s first passenger vessel with a Polar Class 2 hull – meaning it can go deeper and further into the ice in polar regions – when it debuted in 2021. Two of Aurora Expeditions’ ships, the Greg Mortimer and Sylvia Earle, use a patented inverted bow, designed to slide gently through the waves, reducing impact and vibration and improving stability, rather than “punching” through the water as a regular bow shape does, which makes the bow rock up and down. Lonsdale says that the fancier the vessel and the offerings onboard, the more distractions you’ll have if bad weather hits. Newer boats often have more spacious rooms and bigger windows so that you can watch the horizon, which helps to lessen seasickness. If the budget allows, she says, book a suite – you won’t just get more space, you’ll (likely) have floor-to-ceiling windows, too. But a word of advice – she recommends a careful selection not just of the right operator for you, but of the ship itself. “Just because a company has a fleet with a very modern ship doesn’t mean the whole fleet will be like that,” she says. So you’ve conquered your fears, booked your ticket and you’re about to set sail. Bad news: the captain is predicting the Drake shake. What to do? Hopefully you’ve come prepared. Most ships have ginger candies on offer during bad weather, but bring your own, as well as any anti-seasickness medication you want to take. Some passengers swear by acupressure “seeds”: tiny spikes, attached to your ears with a sticking plaster, designed to stimulate acupuncture points. Some ships offer acupuncture onboard; alternatively you can get it done beforehand, since the seeds last for some time. Devorsine’s top tips are to keep your eyes on the horizon, hold onto the handrail when walking around, be careful around doors, and “don’t jump out of bed.” Jamie Lafferty, a photographer who leads excursions on Antarctic cruises, says that of his 30-odd crossings, “I’ve had one where it felt like I was going to fall out of bed and that was the second time, way back in 2010 when there was a lot more guesswork involved. Crossing the Drake Passage is much, much more benign than it used to be thanks to the accuracy of modern forecasting models and stabilizers on more modern cruise ships. This doesn’t mean it’ll be smooth, but it’s vastly less chaotic and unpredictable than it used to be.” His top tip? “Take seasickness medication before heading out into open sea – once you start spewing, tablets aren’t going to be any use.” Warren Cairns, senior researcher at the Institute of Polar Sciences of the National Research Council of Italy, has a bit of extra help. “The only thing that works for me is going to the ship’s medic for a scopolamine patch,” he says. “It’s so rough, normal seasickness pills are just to get me to the infirmary.” Although he has it worse than the average tourist – on trips to Antarctica, their research ships have to pause for house to take samples. “The waves come from all sorts of directions as the thrusters keep it in place,” he says. “When you’re underway it’s a much more regular motion.” Lonsdale says it’s important not to fight it if you feel ill: “Just go to bed.” But equally, she says, don’t expect it: “It may be calm. You may not feel ill.” People suffer differently from seasickness she says. “The Pacific has very long, slow swells, Channel crossings [between the UK and France] have quite a bouncy experience. Lots of people say crossing the Drake in very rough weather is uneven enough to not make them ill at all.” On that plate-smashing crossing, for example, this reporter – who was watching 40-foot waves from the observation deck – never got sick. Remember that however it feels, you’re safe. “There’s an extraordinary level of safety in the build of those ships doing this,” says Lonsdale. Add in the safety margins that the likes of Devorsine build in, and you’re in uncomfortable, but not dangerous, territory. And if all else fails, remember why you’re there. “The motivation and excitement to discover those latitudes is very important to fight the seasickness,” says Devorsine. Lonsdale agrees. “If you were going to the moon, you’d expect the journey to be uncomfortable but it’d be worth it,” she says. “You just have to think, ‘This is what I need to get from one world to another.’”",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/drake-passage-rough-sea-scn/index.html,"’ body water instils fear inspires sailor equal measure six hundred mile open sea roughest condition planet –

11,Video shows US launching strikes against Iranian-backed targets in Yemen,"Editor’s Note: Khalil Gibran Muhammad is the Ford Foundation Professor of History, Race and Public Policy at Harvard University, an organizer of the Freedom to Learn movement and co-host of the Some of My Best Friends Are podcast. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. Black History Month, which gets underway this week, is a chance to give Americans the timely reminder that you can’t teach our history honestly without understanding Black struggle and triumph. Take race and racism out of the American story and very little about the country is comprehensible. The way we elect our presidents. The civil rights enshrined in the 14th Amendment that gives birthright citizenship to formerly excluded Asian immigrants and grants marriage equality to same-sex couples. The nation’s intergenerational wealth accumulated during 350 years of slavery and segregation. And the outsize cultural visibility of African American creative talent on the world stage. Because Black patriots have carried the flame of American democracy for everyone, and for centuries, Black people continue to be overrepresented in pro-democracy movements in the United States — the very movements that some people, particularly some top Republicans and leading figures on the right — seek so desperately to destroy in their zeal to pass voter suppression laws and their efforts to diminish freedom of speech and assembly rights. Nowhere are these attacks more evident right now than on college campuses. Many academics who teach about the history of race and racism in America, as I do, are being unjustifiably blamed for the rise in antisemitism on campus and falsely accused of creating racial divisions in the country. This has had the undesirable effect of putting us in the crosshairs of some of the most powerful people in the country, including Republican politicians, conservative activists and billionaire donors. Last week, at my alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, about 100 faculty rallied against what they decried as “anti-democratic” attacks on diversity, academic freedom and free speech. Faculty and staff at private universities across the country now face a similar plight, as do many teachers, librarians and academics at public colleges and universities who have been censored, harassed, physically threatened and fired for doing their jobs over the past year. As these dangerous assaults move to private universities, many academics are preparing for the worst. I count myself among them. Last year, for the first time in my 25-year career as an academic historian, my teaching was singled out by a powerful politician for causing hate. When GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx opened the December 5 congressional hearing about antisemitism on campus, she targeted a class taught by me as a “prime example” of a “race-based ideology” that has caused Harvard University to be “ground zero for antisemitism following October 7.” Foxx also cited two additional campus examples of “institutional antisemitism and hate” — a Global Health seminar on “Scientific Racism and Anti-Racism” and an initiative at the Harvard Divinity School on “Social and Racial Justice.” Then, on January 2, just hours after Claudine Gay announced her resignation under pressure Foxx promised to keep her congressional investigation into Harvard going because “postsecondary education,” the lawmaker wrote in a statement, has been hijacked by “political activists, woke faculty and partisan administrators.” If by “woke” Foxx means teaching the truth about American history, then I’m guilty as charged. There are few aspects of America’s past that haven’t been impacted by conscientious Black people and their resistance to systemic racism and illiberal democracy. The charge against me of promulgating a “race-based ideology” that fosters antisemitic views is especially preposterous since the coursework I teach on the history of anti-Jewish hatred and discrimination shows how Blacks and Jews have common enemies in neo-Nazis, replacement theorists and white domestic terrorists in the US. Members of these same groups frequently voice support for the current leader of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump, who has employed language that resembles the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler. Right-wing office holders targeting academics is the latest battlefront in a three-year-old political war on education that started with Trump’s ban on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) training in federal agencies, and then metastasized to numerous states criminalizing books and curricula on racism, gender discrimination and sexuality in public primary and secondary schools. Florida recently banned sociology from the core curriculum of the nation’s largest public university system, which serves 430,000 students, because “it has been hijacked by left-wing activists,” according to the state commissioner of education. Foxx and her political ilk want people to believe that what happens in my classroom and the classrooms of many other academics across the country is a part of a woke conspiracy meant to indoctrinate White Americans to hate themselves and their country. They want the public to believe that those of us who teach the truth about the history of race and racism are the real racists and antisemites in America, as these enemies of racial progress and democracy attempt to stand reality on its head. The situation at Harvard has been made more dire by the university’s failure to push back sufficiently against broader political attacks. In his first university statement as interim president, Alan Garber issued a broad affirmation of the university’s commitment to “free inquiry and expression, in a climate of inclusion and mutual respect.” But as the new semester got underway in January, there was no written statement by senior university officials assuring faculty who teach about racism or staff who hold various functions in the area of DEI that we are safe to do our jobs. Boilerplate assurances of academic freedom were commonplace before Gay became president and certainly were issued frequently before October 7, when antisemitism became weaponized against anyone teaching about racism or colonialism or who dared to speak about the history of Israel’s occupation of Gaza. And to be clear, I mean anyone — not just Black faculty. Just last week, on the first day of the spring semester, President Garber came under fire for appointing Derek J. Penslar, a prolific and well-respected scholar of Jewish history, to be the co-chair of Harvard’s reconstituted presidential task force combating antisemitism. Penslar is accused of being soft on antisemitism by Bill Ackman, the billionaire donor who says DEI is the “root cause” of Harvard’s alleged antisemitism and is a prominent supporter of Foxx’s congressional investigation. Another vocal critic of Penslar is the former Harvard president Lawrence Summers, who was also an outspoken opponent of Gay’s. He wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter) that Penslar’s views are disqualifying because he has invoked “the concept of settler colonialism in analyzing Israel” and has labeled it “an apartheid state.” The tragedy is that the academics most committed to learning from the past — who have dedicated their entire careers to staring into the abyss of oppression, in an effort to teach the concept of “Never Again” and how it applies to all people — are the ones least protected in this moment. Black faculty and staff feel especially vulnerable. As my friend who is a Black staffer at a Florida community college told me recently: “I am on the opposite end of the educational spectrum than Harvard, but our realities are the same in many respects.” Some Black colleagues on my campus have told me they are concerned about the risk to their careers and reputations from “teaching while Black” in this climate. Even some Black alumni are weighing whether it is safe to speak up about Gay’s swift demise as Harvard’s first Black woman president, especially in light of what was believed by many of us to be a political hit job for her commitment to DEI. “People are afraid,” one alum told me. “If it can happen to her, it can happen to any of us.” If the oldest, richest and most powerful American university won’t defend its own people and resist political efforts to interfere with unvarnished truth-telling and academic freedom, then shame on Harvard. As an academic institution, we should be leading the resistance to these assaults on higher education, not bowing to them. Silence is a failure of leadership in times like these. Harvard, with its motto “Veritas” — truth — owes it to all of us on the frontlines of these false attacks to defend us for teaching and practicing the very values it claims to uphold. And for those of us who believe that a rigorous, equitable, inclusive and above all else honest education is the only kind worth having in a multi-racial democracy, we must be courageous, stand together and continue teaching the truth.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/opinions/black-history-month-racism-harvard-antisemitism-muhammad/index.html,editor ’ note khalil gibran muhammad ford

13,The problem with the US bombing strikes,"In eight days, 65,000 football fans (some hoping to catch a glimpse of Taylor Swift) will descend upon Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas to attend the most-viewed American sporting event of the year. Between the hot dogs, the beers and probably during Usher’s greatest hits, the Super Bowl spectators will likely visit one of Allegiant’s 297 restrooms. And the restrooms are ready. In the summer of 2020, days before the new $2 billion stadium opened its doors to the public, building technicians flushed its nearly 1,430 toilets and urinals. Simultaneously. It worked. Figuring out how to keep restrooms functioning and lines short is tricky at a sporting event where people typically excuse themselves to use the restroom at the exact same point - right around halftime. So, increasingly, there’s science to designing restrooms for thousands of people and laws and codes that cover it. Gender politics also comes into play. Long lines for the restroom are what architects call a “friction point,” and, potentially, a costly one. The average price for a Super Bowl ticket is currently hovering around $9,800. That means a 15-minute wait for the restroom could cost attendees $612. Delays also take away from the fan experience and cut into time that could be spent at the concession stands or gift shops and bars, limiting potential revenue for the stadium. So what’s the new science of stadium restrooms? To start, states have building codes that require the installation of a certain number of restrooms per person. In Nevada, a stadium like Allegiant is required to provide about one lavatory for every 120 men and one for every 60 women. That’s bare minimum, and most modern arenas go well beyond that, said Jonathan Emmett, a principal and design director at Gensler specializing in sports and entertainment venues. “(Designers and architects) really had to step up our game in terms of the number of fixtures that are provided, the efficiency of those bathrooms and getting people in through those bathrooms as quickly as possible,” said Emmett, who has helped design several football stadiums including Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Philadelphia Eagles. Beyond the number of stalls, design can also improve restroom flow. Lots of small restrooms are better than a few large ones, for instance. “Travel distance is important,” he said. “We want to get as many of the amenities, whether it’s for restrooms or concessions, as close to the user as possible, so they’re not having to traverse down a long concourse to find the bathroom.” Large restrooms also tend to have other problems. When there are long lines for big restrooms at older venues, it’s often the case that many of the stalls are actually empty. “Because people don’t have a clear sightline or there isn’t a clear circulation path, trying to find an empty stall can be difficult and then you’re not getting the efficiency,” he said. And if there’s an influx of female Taylor Swift fans on game night, the stadium should be OK, said Emmett. Many theaters, airports and public buildings are famous for long lines around women’s restrooms but none by the men’s. That’s started to change in recent years. Newer arenas are built to host a mix of events that attract different demographics, and their restrooms reflect that. Allegiant could host a sports event with a majority of male attendees but the next week could be a Taylor Swift concert with mostly teenage girls. Arena management now has to think about the event mix in large, multipurpose buildings and account for the different crowds on different days. Some designers and architects believe that these problems mean that new buildings might trend towards gender neutral restrooms in the coming years. Restrooms are “a public health issue and it’s a human rights issue,” said Kathryn Anthony, an architecture professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a board member of the American Restroom Association. Her studies have focused on potty parity – the idea that men and women should have equal speed of access to restrooms. “It shouldn’t take (women) longer to access the restroom than it does for a man to access the restroom, that’s really the issue,” she said. Studies show that women take about twice as long as men do to use the restroom. For a long time, that went unseen by architects designing public facilities, said Anthony. “There’s been a relative lack of awareness and sensitivity to the needs of women and girls in restrooms,” she said. Part of that problem was that until recently, the field of architecture was dominated by men. Anthony says there needs to be “a reawakening of the American public to just how important restrooms are and the fact that we all need them.” Groups like the World Toilet College, American Restroom Association and the World Toilet Organization say that the right to a clean and readily available restroom is a basic one. Sports arenas have been particularly lacking. In the 22 years that Cintas has given out the America’s Best Bathroom Award, it has often gone to a theater, museum and even a supermarket, but a sports stadium has never taken the prize. This year’s winner, the Baltimore/Washington International Airport, has laid the groundwork for the future of restroom design. Twenty-four million people pass through the airport annually and internal surveys have consistently shown that restrooms were the number one issue affecting passenger satisfaction at the airport, said Jo Schneider, director of architecture for the airport and the Maryland Aviation Administration. “It’s crazy,” said Schneider “It’s not the airlines or the waiting area or the concessions that matter. It’s the restrooms.” That’s why after a lot of feedback from disgruntled customers, the airport decided it was time for a $55 million overhaul of some facilities. Some of the restrooms at the airport hadn’t been updated in a quarter of a century, said Schneider. They weren’t built to handle carry-on luggage or to accommodate changing family dynamics. The redesign is also more conscious of the needs of the disabled. Stalls were made 20% larger and doors open outwards instead of inwards to give users more space. Stall doors also go from the floor to ceiling, ensuring more privacy as travelers use the facilities or change clothing. Screens alert users to how many free stalls there are and ping custodial staff when soap or paper towels need replacing. Each set of restrooms now has a men’s room, a women’s room, a family room, an adult change room and a lactation room. All of this, said Schneider, has increased the flow through restrooms and limited lines – allowing travelers to get on with their trips or giving them more time to buy a coffee on the way to their gate. And as for the Allegiant’s test “Super Flush” years before the Super Bowl, the goal was to put a huge load on the arena’s plumbing system to make sure no problems arise at big events like the upcoming February 11 match-up between the Kansas Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers. “We don’t ever want there to be 60,000 or 70,000 people in the building and have the system fail,” said Julie Amacker, director for CAA Icon, which served as a project manager for the stadium’s construction, in a video depicting the project. “This is one of the last boxes to check that says we’re ready.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/business/why-this-super-bowl-is-all-about-the-bathrooms/index.html,"eight day sixty-five thousand football fan hoping catch glimpse taylor swift descend

14,See CENTCOM images of F-18 taking off from aircraft carrier,"The consecration of a controversial Hindu temple symbolizes the seismic shift from India’s secular founding values, analysts say, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi disregards norms separating religion from state in his push to win a rare third term this year. Modi presided over a lavish opening ceremony last month of the Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir in the sacred town of Ayodhya, fulfilling a longstanding promise to voters that helped propel him and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to power in 2014. “(Today) is the beginning of a new time cycle,” Modi said at the new temple honoring Hindu deity Lord Ram. “After centuries of waiting, our Ram has arrived.” Modi’s vision of a “divine India” is a far cry from the ideas of the modern country’s founding fathers. During nearly a decade in power, the prime minister has enveloped himself in the language of religion in pursuit of his Hindu nationalist agenda, isolating millions among India’s sizable religious minorities. “This moment is both a culmination of a political project that has been 100 years in the making, and a new departure for India, no longer a secular republic,” said political scientist Gilles Verniers, a senior fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. “India becomes a de facto Hindu nation, where the task of building national Hindu religious symbols falls to the state. And in which its leader officiates simultaneously as prime minister and head priest for the country.” The Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir stands on the site of the Babri Masjid, a 16th century mosque that was destroyed by hardline Hindus in 1992, setting off a wave of deadly sectarian violence not seen in India since its bloody 1947 partition. The temple’s inauguration was attended by thousands of hand-picked guests – including cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani – and streamed live to millions across the country. In Ayodhya, billboards celebrating the temple’s opening featured an image of Hindu deity Ram alongside Modi’s face, with the leader of his BJP even dubbing the prime minister “The King of Gods.” Modi fasted for 11 days in a purification ritual before the event and visited temples across the country, performing customs sacramental to India’s majority faith. He publicly called himself “an instrument” of Lord Ram, anointed by the divine to “represent all the people of India.” At the consecration, Modi presided over the “Pran Pratishtha” – the unveiling of the much-anticipated Ram idol – taking on a role typically reserved for priests. The move was well received in most quarters, with his supporters praising the leader’s actions. But for some Hindus, Modi’s actions represent a betrayal of their religion for political capital. “This is obviously an electoral stunt, it should not be happening in the name of my faith,” said Indian American activist Sunita Viswanath and member of the US-based Hindus for Human Rights group in a statement the day before the temple opening. “Modi is not a priest, so leading this ceremony for political gain is both technically and morally wrong. This weaponization of our religion tramples what’s left of India’s secular democratic values.” Yet, in blurring the lines between state and religion, Modi has achieved what his predecessors were unable to, analysts say. “Much of this is about solidifying his image in India as someone who is devout, someone who delivers on his promises,” said Foreign Policy editor-in-chief and former CNN New Delhi bureau chief, Ravi Agrawal. “This is a very popular move, and while it’s being criticized… it remains popular in a country that is 80% Hindu.” Modi rose to power in 2014 with a pledge to reform India’s economy and usher in a new era of development – but he also heavily pushed a Hindutva agenda, an ideology that believes India should become a land for Hindus. When he stood for reelection in 2019, Modi’s Hindutva policies became more brazen, according to analysts. A few months after winning, he announced he was stripping the statehood of India’s only Muslim-majority territory, Jammu and Kashmir, and turning it into two union territories while bringing it under federal control. Later that year, his government passed a controversial citizenship law considered by many to be discriminatory against Muslims. And he reiterated his party’s desire to build the Ram Temple on the contested holy site. Many Hindus believe the Babri Masjid was built on the ruins of a Hindu temple, allegedly destroyed in 1528 by Babar, the first Mughal emperor of South Asia. For years, they rallied to tear down the mosque and make way for a temple. The dispute reached its climax in 1992 when, spurred on by the BJP and right-wing groups, Hindu hardliners attacked the mosque, triggering widespread communal violence that killed more than 2,000 people nationwide. In a victory for Modi and his supporters, India’s Supreme Court in 2019 granted Hindus permission to build the temple, ending the decades-long dispute – but dealing a blow to millions of Muslims who fear that religious divisions are becoming more pronounced under Modi’s BJP government. The Indian government denies it is discriminating against minorities, but analysts say last week’s festivities have only emboldened right-wing Hindus to act with impunity against minorities. Communal tensions rose in western Maharashtra state, with three reported altercations between Hindus and Muslims, according to local police. In a separate incident in central Madhya Pradesh state, a group of right-wing Hindus was seen placing saffron flags on top of a Christian church. The color is closely associated with Hinduism. “India has become more majoritarian. India has become more nationalist. India has become more pro-Hindu,” Agrawal said. “This is partly due to the government’s ability to point to India’s history and the wrongs they perceive India to have faced.” Since assuming power nearly a decade ago, Modi has positioned himself as a disrupter of India’s colonial legacy, often in speeches marked by emotive language. He has emphasized the need to “liberate (India) from the slavery mindset,” making steps to steer the country away from what the government has called the “vestiges of British rule.” Similarly, Modi has also made comments about India’s erstwhile Islamic rulers, the Mughals, who ruled much of the country from 1526 to 1858. Many hardline Hindus believe the era was a period of oppression under Muslim rule, a view that has also been echoed by some members of the BJP. Hindu groups have for decades claimed the Mughals destroyed Hindu temples, building mosques and other monuments in their place. Many of these cases are now being debated in courts across the country, in a move Indian liberals fear could spark further violence and disharmony. Just this week, a court in the city of Varanasi ruled that Hindus can pray inside the disputed Gyanvapi mosque built by former Mughal ruler Aurangzeb - purportedly on the site of a destroyed Hindu temple – in another major religious dispute. “Aurangzeb severed many heads, but he could not shake our faith,” Modi said in a 2022 speech, referring to the ruler who died more than three centuries ago. As the country heads toward a national election expected to be held in April and May, the government “sees itself as addressing these injustices,” said Foreign Policy’s Agrawal. Gilles, the political scientist, said last week’s display of Hindu nationalism at the Ram Temple shows the strength of the alliance between the BJP and India’s business and cultural elites. The temple’s inauguration was a “dark day for India’s religious minorities,” he said. “(They) have officially become second-class citizens.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/05/india/india-modi-ram-temple-analysis-intl-hnk/index.html,"consecration controversial hindu temple symbolizes seismic shift india ’ secular founding value

15,Over 11 million in California at high risk of potentially life-threatening flooding,"Since joining Liverpool in 2022, Darwin Núñez has continued to be an entertaining, yet polarizing presence in the English Premier League. On one hand, the 24-year-old has all the physical attributes to be a world-class striker. He’s fast, strong and has shown signs he can score from almost anywhere when in the mood. But the Uruguayan is also raw and many question whether he has the technical ability to be a consistent threat at the very top of the sport. This juxtaposition was on full display in Livepool’s league win against Chelsea on Wednesday, where Núñez missed a penalty, made a wonderful assist and then set an unwanted record. While the Reds won 4-1, the scoreline could have been even more emphatic had Núñez not hit the woodwork on four occasions – a Premier League record for a single game. Two of those missed chances were brilliant efforts from the striker, but the other two were opportunities he really should have converted. The first was a missed penalty just before half-time which, despite hitting well, he directed against the post. The second was a stooping header in the second half which really should have been a goal. Despite the missed chances, Núñez did pop up with a brilliant assist for Luis Díaz who made it 4-1 to the six-time European champions. When asked about his striker’s performance after the game, Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp tried to put a positive spin on it. “Think you are in his boots, how that feels. Missing a penalty, you could see it at half-time, he was really upset with himself. Then missing the header from close range, but then setting up a goal. He stays in the game,” Klopp told reporters. “It is just crazy that he creates that many [chances]. Imagine for a second he would take them all, the numbers would be absolutely insane to the extent where you wouldn’t understand it anymore.” According to the Premier League, Núñez now leads the way in big chances missed this season (20), three more than Manchester City’s Erling Haaland, who sits in second. The Liverpool forward also taken the most shots, been caught offside the most times and hit the woodwork more than any other player in the league this season. Despite his lack of cutting edge in front of goal, Liverpool fans have seemingly taken to the striker, serenading him with chants throughout the game against Chelsea. “I thought he did everything but score a goal. He will be a nightmare for [defenders] to play against, whether he scores or not,” pundit and former Manchester United star Rio Ferdinand told TNT Sports after the match. “He runs you into bad places, he’s aggressive, he ricochets everything […] he’s a handful who will end up getting goals at this club.” With seven league goals to his name so far this season, Núñez has undoubtedly been a pivotal part of his team’s rise to the top of the Premier League – it now sits five places ahead of Manchester City in second, having played one game more. If Liverpool is going to see off the title challenge from the reigning league champion, it will need to rely on the likes of Núñez to keep finding the back of the net. Whether he can do that is yet to be seen, but Liverpool fans will certainly enjoy their agent of chaos either way.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/sport/liverpool-darwin-nunez-unwanted-record-spt-intl/index.html,since joining liverpool two thousand and twenty-two darwin núñez continued entertaining yet polarizing presence english premier league one hand 24yearold physical attribute worldclass striker ’ fast strong shown sign score almost anywhere mood uruguayan also raw many question whether technical ability consistent threat top sport juxtaposition full display livepool ’ league win chelsea wednesday núñez missed penalty made wonderful assist set unwanted record red forty-one scoreline could even emphatic núñez hit woodwork four occasion – premier league record single game two missed chance brilliant effort striker two opportunity really converted first missed penalty halftime despite hitting well directed post second stooping header second half really goal despite missed chance núñez pop brilliant assist luis díaz made forty-one sixtime european champion asked striker ’ performance game liverpool manager jürgen klopp tried put positive spin “ think boot feel missing penalty could see halftime really upset missing header close range setting goal stay game ” klopp told reporter “ crazy creates many chance imagine second would take number would absolutely insane extent ’ understand anymore ” according premier league núñez lead way big chance missed season twenty three manchester city ’ erling haaland sits second liverpool forward also taken shot caught offside time hit woodwork player league season despite lack cutting edge front goal liverpool fan seemingly taken striker serenading chant throughout game chelsea “ thought everything score goal nightmare defender play whether score ” pundit former manchester united star rio ferdinand told tnt sport match “ run bad place ’ aggressive ricochet everything … ’ handful end getting goal club ” seven league goal name far season núñez undoubtedly pivotal part team ’ rise top premier league – sits five place ahead manchester city second played one game liverpool going see title challenge reigning league champion need rely like núñez keep finding back net whether yet seen liverpool fan certainly enjoy agent chaos either way,4
16,Power outages ‘climbing like crazy’ as storm hits California,"Several media reports are echoing Biden administration talking points that the retaliatory strikes on more than 85 targets in Iraq and Syria last night were designed to “send a message” following a drone attack by an Iranian-backed militia that killed three US servicemembers in Jordan. But what exactly was the message and how is it likely to be received? Let’s consider how these strikes have been framed. On Tuesday, President Joe Biden told reporters he had made his decision about what he was going to do, while the White House national security spokesperson said, “It’s fair for you to expect that we will respond in an appropriate fashion…” That gave any member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps living in Iraq and Syria several days’ notice to pack their bags and head elsewhere. The Biden administration has also repeatedly said it doesn’t want to go to war with Iran. But part of establishing deterrence is not to say what you won’t do but to leave some strategic ambiguity about what you can and might do. Given the largely unsuccessful history of such US strikes against Iranian proxy groups in the Middle East, the US’ response, along with any subsequent military action, is unlikely to deter Iranian proxies from further attacks on American targets and shipping in the region. To tamp down the possibility of a wider regional war, the US needs to focus its efforts on addressing the underlying cause of this roiling conflict: the continued war in Gaza. Previous US strikes have failed to deter Iran and its proxies. The US has repeatedly struck Houthi targets in Yemen in recent weeks, but the Iranian-armed Houthis kept launching missiles at commercial shipping in the Red Sea and came close to striking a US warship on Tuesday. On Friday, US forces shot down 12 Houthis drones over the course of roughly 12 hours. On Saturday, the US struck six Houthi anti-ship cruise missiles just hours before the US and the UK conducted additional strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, hitting at least 30 targets across 10 locations. We’ve seen this time and again. In January 2020, the Trump administration ordered a drone strike that killed the most important Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, framing it as an act of deterrence against attacks on Americans in the region. Less than a week later, Iran launched ballistic missiles at two US bases in Iraq, causing more than 100 US soldiers to be treated for traumatic brain injuries. A US drone strike last month, which killed the leader of an Iranian-backed militia in Baghdad had similarly undesirable knock-on effects. It gave the Iraqi government more ammunition in its negotiations with the US to call for the withdrawal of 2,500 American troops still based in Iraq — a move that would fulfill an important Iranian policy goal. Let’s not forget that the Biden administration already made a grave mistake when it pulled all US troops out of Iran’s neighbor Afghanistan in the summer of 2021. You can imagine the high fives in Tehran when that happened. Withdrawing from Iraq would be another failure that only serves Iran’s interests, especially since a United Nations report released this past week confirms earlier reports that the “de facto” leader of al-Qaeda, Sayf al-Adl, continues to live in Iran. From Iran’s perspective, its efforts to replace the US as the key regional player in the Middle East seem to be going well. What we need is a clear-eyed acknowledgement that these strikes are not furthering the US’ strategic goals of stopping Iran and its proxies from attacking American targets and allies and that Tehran is continuing to spread its considerable influence in the Middle East from Yemen in the south to Lebanon 1,500 miles to the north. The Prussian general and military strategist Carl von Clausewitz famously observed, “The first, the supreme, the most far-reaching act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish … the kind of war on which they are embarking.” Does the US have any real clue about the kind of conflict it is embarking on? Of course, there are no easy answers and the armchair warriors in DC who are pressing Biden to blow up targets in Iran don’t have to live with what the “day after” looks like and the knock-on effects that might lead to a wider regional conflict in the Middle East. And while US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Friday that the strikes in Iraq and Syria were just “the start of our response,” there isn’t much evidence based on what we’ve seen so far to suggest additional strikes will help. It’s possible that US cyber-attacks in Iran could damage key elements of Iranian military command and control structures, but these kinds of attacks can take many weeks to prepare. The US must move quickly to address the underlying driver of the present regional conflagration that is engulfing the Middle East. That involves halting the war in Gaza, releasing the Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas, and having a plausible plan for the “day after” the guns fall silent in Gaza. That plan cannot involve defunding UNRWA, which is the only institution that can keep Gazans fed, housed and educated, having done so for decades. UNRWA was right to launch an investigation and immediately fire 13 members of its staff who are alleged by Israel to have had some role in Hamas’ October 7 attack. But the reality is that no Arab countries are going to have the capacity or will to feed and house nearly 2 million Gazans and the idea that Israel will be able to do so as an occupying force without facing an intense local insurgency is wishful thinking of the highest order. The Biden administration is forced to choose from a menu of difficult choices as it tries to contain the metastasizing regional conflict in the Middle East while also balancing America’s strategic objectives of helping Israel dismantle Hamas’ military wing and releasing the remaining Israeli and American hostages held in Gaza, while also containing the threats from Iran and its proxies.

17,China hands Australian writer a suspended death penalty,"Sexually explicit AI-generated photos of pop superstar Taylor Swift have flooded the internet, and we don’t need to calm down. Swift may be one of the most famous women in the world, but she represents every woman and every girl when it comes to what’s at stake in the future of artificial intelligence and consent. I’ve been in the trenches covering the impact of technology for nearly 15 years, and I believe sexually explicit deepfakes are one of the most significant threats we face with advances in AI. With the proliferation of AI-generated tools and Silicon Valley’s tendency to race to innovate, we are entering a phase of tech that feels familiar — only now, the stakes are even higher. We are in an era where it’s not just our data that’s up for grabs, it’s our most intimate qualities: Our voices, our faces, our bodies can all now be mimicked by AI. Put simply: Our humanity is a click away from being used against us. And if it can happen to Swift, it can happen to you. The biggest mistake we can make is believing that this type of harm is reserved for public figures. We are now seeing a democratization of image-generating apps enabling this type of behavior. Did your crush reject you? There’s an app for that. Now, you can digitally undress her or create your own explicit deepfake starring her. The problem will only get worse as we move into augmented and virtual worlds. Imagine an immersive environment where a scorned ex invites others to collectively view a sexually explicit deepfake video of the girl who rejected him. Earlier this month, it was reported that British police are investigating the case of a 16-year old who alleged being raped in the virtual world by multiple attackers. I recently spoke to George Washington University professor Dr. Mary Anne Franks, who specializes in civil rights, tech and free speech. She had a chilling warning: These types of apps and AI tools could lead to a new generation of young men with a “my wish is AI’s command” mentality. If we’re not careful, not only will we create a new generation of victims, but also a new generation of abusers. “We’ve just made all these tools — confused, resentful, angry young men are just using [them] instead of trying to sort through what it means to deal in a healthy way with rejection,” Franks said. Leveraging advances in technology to humiliate women is nothing new. In 2015, I created a series at CNN called “Revenge Porn: The Cyberwar Against Women.” At the time, non-consensual pornography — where a scorned ex or bad actor published naked photos of women on websites devoted to shaming them — was rampant. Like today, the laws had yet to catch up and tech companies weren’t yet making changes to protect victims. During that investigation, I will never forget looking at websites hosted on the dark web that featured non-consensual pornography of teenage girls. A security researcher who specialized in online abuse (and tracking down abusers) showed me the depths of the problem, guiding me through forums and images I will never unsee. On one site, perpetrators compromised teenagers’ web cameras and forced young girls to perform sexual acts with a threat: If you don’t comply, we’ll send your private images we’ve recorded to all your classmates. Fast forward to 2024. Imagine your teenager receives a sexually explicit video of themselves in a DM. They never taped a video, but due to advances in deepfake technology, it’s impossible to distinguish whether it’s real or fake. In a world where AI makes fiction so believable, truth and our perception of truth aren’t far apart. The feeling of shame, loss of control and helplessness doesn’t change because an image or video isn’t technically “real.” Swift’s deepfake nightmare is just the tip of the iceberg highlighting the existential threat women and girls face. While X may have removed the viral posts (after they were viewed tens of millions of times), there are still a number of alternative sites devoted to this type of exploitative content. One particular site, racking in millions of views a month, features pages of sexually explicit deepfake videos devoted to Swift and other celebrities who did not consent to having their likeness used for pornographic purposes. The genie is hard to put back in the bottle, and the cure comes with a cost. On Saturday, searches for Swift were blocked on X, with the company telling CNN that the move was temporary to “prioritize safety.” In order to protect one of the most famous women on the planet, X temporarily had to make her invisible. While it’s a temporary move, the message has lasting impact: If one of the most famous women must disappear online in order to be safe, what does that mean for the rest of us? I’ve thought a lot about what would actually move the needle. From a policy perspective, a handful of states have laws against the creation or sharing of these types of sexually explicit deepfakes. All of those laws vary in scope — so where someone is able to bring charges makes a difference. If, for example, Swift filed in New York as a resident of the state — New York’s law requires the victim of this type of abuse to prove intent to cause harm, an increasingly difficult feat for AI-generated sexually explicit images, Franks said. “Intent to harm is a very restrictive requirement because, as with other forms of image-based sexual abuse, there are lots of other motives [including] sexual gratification, to make money, to gain notoriety, to achieve social status,” Franks said. “Statutes that require intent to cause harm give all of those perpetrators a free pass.” To file criminal charges, Swift would be required to track down the perpetrator(s) — which is both expensive and difficult to accomplish, all while risking further exposure. This points to the reality that even states with existing laws have a prohibitively complex road to prosecution. “Someone like Taylor Swift has lawyers and someone who can help do this,” Franks said. “Your average victim is not going to have any assistance.” Franks says the ideal federal bill would include criminal and civil penalties, citing the bipartisan Preventing Deepfakes of Intimate Images Act, which would criminally prohibit the disclosure of sexually explicit digital images without consent and provide civil recourse for victims. Because laws banning deepfakes are challenging to enforce, lawmakers in Vermont recently introduced legislation that would hold developers of generative AI products accountable for the harms they create that are reasonably foreseeable. These are first steps, but legislation is being outpaced by the speed at which the technology is unfolding. It doesn’t seem fair to ask Swift to be our spokesperson for this, but I strongly believe that she — and the powerful coalition of fans that share her ethos — may be our best shot at building the momentum needed to create meaningful change starting now. Don’t get me wrong, there would be enormous hurdles and a personal cost for any woman, even a woman in Swift’s position, but given that she’s already reshaped the music industry and created a micro economy from her tour, I wouldn’t put anything past her. In the Swift universe, injustice is a stepping stone, heartbreak becomes an anthem, and every disappointment is an opportunity to grow. Hopefully, we can use this moment to collectively raise our voices to sing the ultimate ballad: one where we have consent over our bodies, online.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/31/opinions/taylor-swift-deepfakes-ai-segall/index.html,sexually explicit aigenerated photo pop superstar taylor swift flooded internet ’ need calm swift may

18,Lionel Messi no-show ignites booing and calls for refunds at Inter Miami match in Hong Kong,"French soccer superstar Kylian Mbappé will be on the move this summer, as he’s reportedly agreed to join Real Madrid once his contract with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) ends at the end of the season, according to multiple reports, including Le Parisien and ESPN, citing unnamed sources. Mbappé has been linked to a possible move to the Spanish giants over the last couple of years, but nothing ever unfolded as he remained in Paris. According to ESPN, Mbappé has not informed PSG or Real Madrid of his decision but is expected to make an announcement next week. Last year, the 25-year-old said he would not renew his contract at PSG, which expires at the end of the 2023-24 season when he could leave Paris for free. He is now free to sign a precontract agreement with a new club. CNN has reached out to PSG, Real Madrid and Mbappé’s representation for comment. The 2018 World Cup winner joined PSG as a 17-year-old in 2017 from AS Monaco, where he has since become the club’s all-time leading scorer, and led the French side to five league titles. The superstar striker is considered peerless on the pitch and has cemented a glowing reputation off it, donating his World Cup winnings – reportedly as much as $500,000 – to Premiers de Cordée, a charity offering sporting opportunities to children who are hospitalized or have disabilities. He’s regarded as such a symbol of French excellence that when rumors of his departure for Madrid swirled in 2022, the country’s president phoned him and urged him to stay. “I never imagined I’m gonna talk with the president about my future in my career, so it’s something crazy, really something crazy,” Mbappé said in an interview with The New York Times. “He told me: ‘I want you to stay. I don’t want you to leave now. You are so important for the country.’” Real Madrid has long had a history of having some of soccer’s biggest superstars in its ranks. The 2005/06 Galácticos squad boasted the likes of David Beckham, Ronaldo Nazário and Zidane, among countless other megastars. Fast-forward five years and record-breaking signings Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaká were also plying their trade for Los Blancos. Mbappé, for his part, has flirted with Real Madrid year after year. The first time the team came calling for him was when the forward was just 13 years old. Word had gotten around to French football icon, Real Madrid legend and, at the time, Los Merengues sporting director Zinedine Zidane about the talented teenager and he was keen to take a closer look. “My father received a call from someone at Real Madrid, inviting me to come to Spain for a training session over the holiday break,” Mbappé told The Players’ Tribune. “It was a shock because they actually told my father, ‘Zidane would like to see your son.’” In his comic book, ‘Je m’appelle Kylian,’ Mbappé references this meeting and his dreams of one day playing in the famed white shirt of Real Madrid.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/sport/mbappe-to-join-real-madrid-after-psg-contract-expires/index.html,"french soccer superstar kylian mbappé move summer ’ reportedly agreed join real madrid contract paris saintgermain psg end end season according multiple report including le parisien espn citing unnamed source mbappé linked possible move spanish giant last couple year nothing ever unfolded remained paris according espn mbappé informed psg real madrid decision expected make announcement next week last year 25yearold said would renew contract psg expires end two hundred and two thousand, three hundred and twenty-four season could leave paris free free sign precontract agreement new club cnn reached psg real madrid mbappé ’ representation comment two thousand and eighteen world cup winner joined psg 17yearold two thousand and seventeen monaco since become club ’ alltime leading scorer led french side five league title superstar striker considered peerless pitch cemented glowing reputation donating world cup winning – reportedly much five hundred thousand – premier de cordée charity offering sporting opportunity child hospitalized disability ’ regarded symbol french excellence rumor departure madrid swirled two thousand and twenty-two country ’ president phoned urged stay “ never imagined ’ gon na talk president future career ’ something crazy really something crazy ” mbappé said interview new york time “ told ‘ want stay ’ want leave important country ’ ” real madrid long history soccer ’ biggest superstar rank two hundred thousand, five hundred and six galácticos squad boasted like david beckham ronaldo nazário zidane among countless megastars fastforward five year recordbreaking signing cristiano ronaldo kaká also plying trade los blancos mbappé part flirted real madrid year year first time team came calling forward thirteen year old word gotten around french football icon real madrid legend time los merengues sporting director zinedine zidane talented teenager keen take closer look “ father received call someone real madrid inviting come spain training session holiday break ” mbappé told player ’ tribune “ shock actually told father ‘ zidane would like see son ’ ” comic book ‘ je ’ appelle kylian ’ mbappé reference meeting dream one day playing famed white shirt real madrid",2
19,Catch up on the latest global news,"It wasn’t until after photographer Rita Nannini left New York that she grew fascinated by the city’s subways. While living in Manhattan’s Upper West Side for some 15 years in the 1980s and early ’90s, Nannini only took short trips on the 1 train for short trips — and rarely, given the subway system’s bad reputation at the time. But after relocating to Princeton, New Jersey, with her husband in the ’90s, Nannini found that absence really did make the heart grow fonder — maybe even for pizza rat. (During visits back to New York to see friends and family in the years since her move, Nannini noted marked improvements in the subway’s facilities and ambience, she told CNN.) And having learned of the “End of the Line” challenge — an urban legend reportedly popular among groups of teens who would board trains at random and ride them until their final destination, just because — Nannini decided to, well, challenge herself, by visiting every first and last stop across the subway’s lines. Nannini’s take on the “End of the Line” experience saw her traveling some 665 miles of subway track across 26 routes and all five of the city’s boroughs. She took over 8,000 photos of the stations at each line’s ends, as well as the communities they served. In many cases, she rode the routes two or three times over to ensure she got ‘the shot.’ She described it, perhaps understatedly, as a “real labor of love.” (“People have asked me, ‘well, don’t you want to do the London Underground next?’” she told CNN in a Zoom interview, laughing. “No thank you, I’m done. I’m done.”) A selection of Nannini’s photos are now presented in her monograph “First Stop, Last Stop” — from the crisp modernity of the Oculus transit hub at the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan (the E train) to the Tudor-inspired architecture of Forest Hills in Queens (the R train); from a child’s baptism in the Atlantic waters off Brooklyn’s Brighton Beach (the B train) to a group of teens’ soccer game in the Williamsbridge Oval park in the Bronx (D train); and from crowds in Times Square to crowds in Grand Central Station, courtesy of the one-stop-long 42nd Street Shuttle train. “(The project) really showed me how important the subway is,” Nannini said, “and how sustainable it makes our lives.” “It’s often said it’s that (my images show) the end of the lines — the ‘last stops,’” she said. “But the end of the line is really the beginning of the line for so many people. That totally reoriented the way that I looked at the project. It made me think about who the people and the communities that live at these points are. And what it is that the subway means to them.” The New York City subway system saw, on average, around 3.2 million riders a day in 2022, the most recent year for which the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has made statistics available. It is the largest public transit system in the US, but its scale belies the (at times unwanted) intimacy of a commute, or the connections that can be fostered among straphangers whether traveling across boroughs or just a couple of local stops. The “End of the Line” experience is just one of many gamified exploits possible to undertake on the New York subways; other similarly Herculean tasks include the “Subway Challenge,” which offers a Guinness World Record for the individual able to stop at all 472 of the city’s stations in the shortest possible time (it’s currently held by Kate Jones, at 22 hours, 14 minutes and 10 seconds) and simply trying to connect through Times Square at rush hour with a carry-on suitcase. Whereas Jones raced around the city, literally, Nannini, was more inclined to take her time, starting her self-imposed challenge in 2013 and only shooting the project’s final images last year. “I took the last shot last January. I was on the A train, and I thought ‘Oh, I really need to get just one more shot out in Inwood,’” Nannini told CNN of finishing touches on her book. “I get on the train and this man sits down across from me, covered in dust. He had gotten off from a construction job, I think. But he had flowers in his hands, and of course, he went right to sleep. The whole ride, I’m thinking, ‘Who’s he giving the flowers to?’ That was the image: his dust-covered hands with flowers. He got off somewhere in Midtown.” When you drive in a car all the time in the suburbs, you don’t have those encounters,” she continued. “Right? People enter your life on the subway. It’s a beautiful thing about New York — and about the subway system.”",https://edition.cnn.com/style/rita-nannini-new-york-subway-photos/index.html,’ photographer rita nannini left new york grew fascinated city ’ subway living manhattan ’ upper west side fifteen year 1980s early ’ ninety nannini took short trip one train short trip — rarely given subway system ’ bad reputation time relocating princeton new jersey husband ’ ninety nannini found absence really make heart grow fonder — maybe even pizza rat visit back new york see friend family year since move nannini noted marked improvement subway ’ facility ambience told cnn learned “ end line ” challenge — urban legend reportedly popular among group teen would board train random ride final destination — nannini decided well challenge visiting every first last stop across subway ’ line nannini ’ take “ end line ” experience saw traveling six hundred and sixty-five mile subway track across twenty-six route five city ’ borough took eight thousand photo station line ’ end well community served many case rode route two three time ensure got ‘ shot ’ described perhaps understatedly “ real labor love ” “ people asked ‘ well ’ want london underground next ’ ” told cnn zoom interview laughing “ thank ’ done ’ done ” selection nannini ’ photo presented monograph “ first stop last stop ” — crisp modernity oculus transit hub world trade center downtown manhattan e train tudorinspired architecture forest hill queen r train child ’ baptism atlantic water brooklyn ’ brighton beach b train group teen ’ soccer game williamsbridge oval park bronx train crowd time square crowd grand central station courtesy onestoplong 42nd street shuttle train “ project really showed important subway ” nannini said “ sustainable make life ” “ ’ often said ’ image show end line — ‘ last stop ’ ” said “ end line really beginning line many people totally reoriented way looked project made think people community live point subway mean ” new york city subway system saw average around thirty-two million rider day two thousand and twenty-two recent year metropolitan transportation authority mta made statistic available largest public transit system u scale belies time unwanted intimacy commute connection fostered among straphanger whether traveling across borough couple local stop “ end line ” experience one many gamified exploit possible undertake new york subway similarly herculean task include “ subway challenge ” offer guinness world record individual able stop four hundred and seventy-two city ’ station shortest possible time ’ currently held kate jones twenty-two hour fourteen minute ten second simply trying connect time square rush hour carryon suitcase whereas jones raced around city literally nannini inclined take time starting selfimposed challenge two thousand and thirteen shooting project ’ final image last year “ took last shot last january train thought ‘ oh really need get one shot inwood ’ ” nannini told cnn finishing touch book “ get train man sits across covered dust gotten construction job think flower hand course went right sleep whole ride ’ thinking ‘ ’ giving flower ’ image dustcovered hand flower got somewhere midtown ” drive car time suburb ’ encounter ” continued “ right people enter life subway ’ beautiful thing new york — subway system ”,2
20,Modi’s ‘divine India’ vision threatens to marginalize millions,"Automakers like Lamborghini, Ferrari, Bentley and Rolls-Royce have been doing well as, regardless of whatever is happening in the wider world’s economy, the ranks of the ultra-wealthy grow and become richer. Lamborghini sold more than 10,000 vehicles last year for the first time ever and Ferrari had a more than 17% increase in revenue. But making money selling a relative handful of cars to a small group of people requires ever-increasing creativity. As a result, extreme levels of personal customization have become the norm in this niche of the auto industry. Instead of just picking interior and exterior colors from a menu, each buyer can ensure his or her supercar or ultra-luxury SUV looks like no other anywhere on earth. In some cases, the wealthiest buyers can even have cars that are built in small – even single digit – numbers only for them. Beyond the raw count, Lamborghini, Rolls-Royce and Bentley achieved record sales of individually customized cars that can cost, in some cases, double the already high base price of one of these vehicles. “We are limited in terms of [market] size and in terms of [market] segments,” said Lamborghini chief executive Stephan Winkelmann in an interview with CNN. “So we have to get the most out of every single car.” Ferrari’s earnings boom announced Thursday was thanks in part to the company’s vehicle personalization program. Ferrari announced revenues of $6.46 billion and profit of $1.36 billion in 2023. The company is expecting more growth in 2024 with its recently launched Purosangue SUV as it continues catering to the wealthiest car enthusiasts. The company’s stock reached a 52-week high Thursday morning at $380 a share. (Seven-time champion Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton joining Ferrari’s racing team may also have contributed to the price run.) Carmakers like these sell to a thin sliver of the global population, those with at least $30 million in potential spending money. That’s around 400,000 people globally, according to Altrata, a company that studies wealth trends. By 2028, Altrata expects 528,000 of the world’s 8 billion people to be in that wealth category. This is a market that’s growing in terms of population but these wealthy people are also getting even wealthier, said Javier Gonzalez Lastra, investment partner with Tema ETFs, which operates a luxury goods investment fund. Global auto sales rose about 9% last year, according S&P. And the most expensive brands are, with some exceptions, growing, too. But, for brands like these, numbers that would be insignificant to a big automaker – like 10,000 Lamborghinis or 13,000 Ferraris – can mean cork-popping success. With such small numbers of cars – and they don’t want to sell too many more or they won’t be “exclusive” anymore – these automakers are expanding the ways they can upsell features, options and extras to this wealthiest groups of buyers. “Personalizations, customizations, have actually been the key driver behind the better than expected earnings throughout the year,” Gonzalez Lastra said. He was speaking of Ferrari, specifically, which had strong earnings growth this year, but the same concept applies to other ultra-luxury automakers, as well. To grow revenues, they have to justify charging their wealthy clients more. “The customer is rich, but he’s not stupid. You have to earn your price increase,” he said, “and to do that you have to bring something new, i.e. a new model, some innovation, something different, or you are customizing things for your client.” Selling options certainly isn’t new in the auto industry. Even mainstream cars from brands like Volkswagen and Ford can be sold with lots of options, a trend that’s been increasing in recent years. But customers purchasing Lamborghinis, Rolls-Royces and Bentleys have an even wider array of infinitely customizable paint colors and interior materials, to start with, than carmakers offer for less expensive brands. Automakers rarely disclose specific prices for these very personalized cars. At the most extreme, carmakers will even create entire cars costing millions of dollars each for just a few customers. But the sorts of customization available to customers of Lamborghini’s Ad Personum program, available on the brand’s supercar models, go beyond just picking from those long lists. Customers can request a “paint-to-sample” color, for instance, in which a car can be painted to match a fabric, leather or paint sample. If the customer has a favorite shirt, for example, the car paint could be matched to the fabric color. But the ideas go way beyond a simple piece of clothing to be matched. “You have what I call it ‘micro metallic’ and you can even go all the way to throw crushed Swarovski diamond dust into the paint,” Pietro Frigerio, a former Lamborghini executive who now runs a Lamborghini dealership in Newport Beach, California, said. One reason the trend is increasing in popularity is simply because the technology has advanced, he added. New paints mean new possibilities. So besides just colors, the paints can have myriad effects and subtle tones. Buyers can even mix different effects of the same color to present subtle patterns and designs. At last year’s Art Basel Miami Beach event, Lamborghini unveiled a Revuelto supercar that looked like it had been driven through streams of fluorescent paint. The car, which was sold to a customer after the show, was created to show off the automaker’s custom paint capabilities. Nearly three quarters of Bentley customers last year requested custom options that go beyond the brand’s already lengthy options list, an increase of 43% from the year before. These more extravagant choices can add around $75,000 to the price of a Bentley car, executives have said. Of course, the more expensive the car, the more extravagant – and potentially expensive – the choices. Rolls-Royce has created a number of Phantom sedans that likely cost multiples of the car’s roughly $500,000 base price. These cars were made with features such as custom embroidery, intricate wood in-lays, etched glass and even hand-painted designs in their interiors. Kellyn Dixon, manager of a Rolls-Royce dealership in Irvine, California, won an award two years ago for selling the most cars worldwide from the brand’s customization program, known as “Rolls-Royce Bespoke.” These are highly customized cars, so much so that Dixon sometimes takes her clients to Rolls Royce headquarters in Goodwood, UK, to meet directly with designers to pick to make their final selections of unique colors, trim pieces and even embroidery and etching. At Dixon’s Rolls-Royce dealership three quarters of the roughly 90 cars sold each year include some degree of custom options, she said. That includes off-menu paint colors and specific objects sealed inside “The Gallery,” a glass case built into the dashboard of the Phantom, and intricate personalized engravings. While she and Rolls-Royce’s design team can provide guidance, in the end, the choices have to be the customer’s. “What is appealing to you may not be appealing to me,” she said, “And at the end of the day, it’s your car. You’re going to take delivery. But there have been some very specific, unique builds that, you know, we pray a little bit when the car gets built that the client loves it as much as they loved the rendering.” Bugatti sells cars starting at $3 million, so you might think just having one of these cars would be distinctive enough. But some customers still want something more. For one customer last year, Bugatti created a gold-painted Chiron on which the brand’s designers hand-drew historical scenes with classic Bugattis. In response to another request, Bugatti designers created contrasting striped paint jobs – one car in blue, one in orange – for a husband and wife. This degree of customization is possible, in part, because these cars are largely hand-made, anyway. Even without lots of customization, it can take months between the time someone orders a Lamborghini or Rolls-Royce and when they actually get the car. Still, said Lamborghini’s Winkelmann, an automaker has to balance production considerations to some degree. “It takes longer for sure,” he said, “therefore, it’s important that we have a balance between the complexity and, at the same time, the opportunity to deliver this to our customers. It’s a continuous discussion, internally, of where we invest in having more opportunities for our customers to buy an individualized car.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/cars/super-rich-people-ultra-luxury-automakers/index.html,automaker like lamborghini ferrari bentley rollsroyce well regardless whatever happening wider world

21,Angry Chinese take to US Embassy’s social media account to vent about plunging stock market,"For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death. Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks. From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard. A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats. River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium. Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s. Neither did severe flooding. Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996. The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters. As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013. Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green. There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast. “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN. “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.” That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010. Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared. The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date. Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor. A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls. Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking. Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on. “It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said. Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are. Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers. Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013. Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long. One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002. A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented. “This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN. “The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.” Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown. It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann. Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing. Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance. Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club. “You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said. “The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it. “We’d love to see them again.” Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake. Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere. Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks. “There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said. “But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark. “They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/18/sport/carbrook-bull-sharks-australia-golf-course-spt-spc-intl/index.html,"golfer staying water could difference winning losing one course

22,Samsung boss acquitted of financial crimes in surprise ruling,"Dubai is set to add another towering figure to its skyline. The Aeternitas Tower, officially unveiled at a launch event last week, will be the world’s tallest residential clock tower at a staggering 450 meters (1,476 feet) tall — more than four times the height of London’s Big Ben, and just 22 meters (72 feet) short of the world’s tallest residential building, the Central Park Tower in New York City. Set to become the world’s second-tallest clock tower (after the Makkah Clock Royal Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia), Aeternitas Tower is the result of a partnership between Dubai-based real estate developer London Gate and Swiss luxury watch manufacturer Franck Muller. London Gate purchased the plot of land in Dubai Marina, which already had the beginnings of an unfinished 106-story structure — and knew that the tower’s monumental size needed a striking facade, said Tom Hill, media relations coordinator for the developer. “We believe the clock will be seen from six kilometers away because of the sheer height of the building,” said Hill, adding that the clock face will be an enormous 40 meters (131 feet) tall and 30 meters (98 feet) wide. “We wanted to do something different that hasn’t been done before in Dubai,” said Hill. The residential tower comprises 649 units, with a mix of one- to three-bedroom apartments, in addition to villa and mansion duplexes. With housekeeping, a concierge service, and a 24-hour valet and porter, residents will have access to hotel-like services and facilities, but with the privacy and comfort of home. Its shared amenities range from health facilities, including a gym, padel court, spa, yoga studio, and swimming pool, to arts and culture spaces such as a cinema, music room, and library. The project will be handed over to residents in 2027, according to London Gate. The tower’s name means “eternity” in Latin, and is inspired by the Franck Muller Aeternitas watch collection — one of the brand’s most complex designs which features an “eternal calendar,” said Erol Baliyan, managing director of Franck Muller in the Middle East and Africa. The Swiss watchmaker sees its step into real estate as a move that will help create a monument that “mirrors the brand’s innovation, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance,” said Baliyan. Aside from the striking clock face (inspired by Franck Muller’s art deco-style Long Island Collection, which has irregular squashed and stretched numbers in a rectangular case), the watchmaker will infuse its design ethos throughout the residence, said Baliyan. He highlights luxury materials like brushed and polished metals, that will be contrasted with marble surfaces, textured fabrics and bold colors. Meanwhile, in the lobby and reception, the signature oblong face of the brand’s Curvex watch is represented with curved walls, archways, and oval furnishings. “Attention to detail is paramount, with meticulously crafted joinery and carefully arranged lighting and furniture, ensuring a refined ambiance,” said Baliyan. The Aeternitas Tower is part of a growing trend in Dubai. Luxury property is booming in the Emirate, and branded residences — collaborations between designer brands and property developers — are surging in popularity. As of October 2023, there were 51 completed projects in the city, a figure that is expected to double by 2030, according to Savills Research, with brands like fashion house Karl Lagerfeld, car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, and hoteliers 25Hours all announcing residential projects in the past year. London Gate began phase one of its sales last week, with one-bedroom apartments starting at AED 1.6 million ($435,600). “We’ve had an unbelievable level of interest since the launch,” said Hill, adding that in the first two days, London Gate sold around 30% of the initial 30-floor release, including all the available one-bedroom apartments. Hill believes that one factor driving interest is the tower’s location in Dubai Marina, where there’s a scarcity of sites for development, adding that an “iconic tower” like the Aeternitas is the first project of its kind to break ground in the district past few years. While this is London Gate’s first branded residence project, it won’t be its last, said Hill, adding that the company will announce its next branded partnership by the end of Q1 this year. As a rapidly evolving market, property in Dubai is often sold off-plan, with buyers waiting years to see their purchase. This is where branded residences provide an extra layer of security, particularly for overseas buyers, said Hill. “When you have a brand as world-renowned as Franck Muller, for example […] you have that peace of mind that you’re going to be handed over a world-class product,” he added.",https://edition.cnn.com/style/dubai-building-worlds-tallest-residential-clock-tower-aeternitas-spc-intl/index.html,"dubai set add another towering figure skyline aeternitas tower officially unveiled launch event last week world ’ tallest residential clock tower staggering four hundred and fifty meter one thousand, four hundred and seventy-six foot tall — four time height london ’ big ben twenty-two meter seventy-two foot short world ’ tallest residential building central park tower new york city set become world ’ secondtallest clock tower makkah clock royal tower mecca saudi arabia aeternitas tower result partnership dubaibased real estate developer london gate swiss luxury watch manufacturer franck muller london gate purchased plot land dubai marina already beginning unfinished 106story structure — knew tower ’ monumental size needed striking facade said tom hill medium relation coordinator developer “ believe clock seen six kilometer away sheer height building ” said hill adding clock face enormous forty meter one hundred and thirty-one foot tall thirty meter ninety-eight foot wide “ wanted something different ’ done dubai ” said hill residential tower comprises six hundred and forty-nine unit mix one threebedroom apartment addition villa mansion duplex housekeeping concierge service 24hour valet porter resident access hotellike service facility privacy comfort home shared amenity range health facility including gym padel court spa yoga studio swimming pool art culture space cinema music room library project handed resident two thousand and twenty-seven according london gate tower ’ name mean “ eternity ” latin inspired franck muller aeternitas watch collection — one brand ’ complex design feature “ eternal calendar ” said erol baliyan managing director franck muller middle east africa swiss watchmaker see step real estate move help create monument “ mirror brand ’ innovation craftsmanship timeless elegance ” said baliyan aside striking clock face inspired franck muller ’ art decostyle long island collection irregular squashed stretched number rectangular case watchmaker infuse design ethos throughout residence said baliyan highlight luxury material like brushed polished metal contrasted marble surface textured fabric bold color meanwhile lobby reception signature oblong face brand ’ curvex watch represented curved wall archway oval furnishing “ attention detail paramount meticulously crafted joinery carefully arranged lighting furniture ensuring refined ambiance ” said baliyan aeternitas tower part growing trend dubai luxury property booming emirate branded residence — collaboration designer brand property developer — surging popularity october two thousand and twenty-three fifty-one completed project city figure expected double two thousand and thirty according savills research brand like fashion house karl lagerfeld car manufacturer mercedesbenz hotelier 25hours announcing residential project past year london gate began phase one sale last week onebedroom apartment starting aed sixteen million four hundred and thirty-five thousand, six hundred “ ’ unbelievable level interest since launch ” said hill adding first two day london gate sold around thirty initial 30floor release including available onebedroom apartment hill belief one factor driving interest tower ’ location dubai marina ’ scarcity site development adding “ iconic tower ” like aeternitas first project kind break ground district past year london gate ’ first branded residence project ’ last said hill adding company announce next branded partnership end q1 year rapidly evolving market property dubai often sold offplan buyer waiting year see purchase branded residence provide extra layer security particularly overseas buyer said hill “ brand worldrenowned franck muller example … peace mind ’ going handed worldclass product ” added",1
23,"Trump makes false claims about Iraq, Iran and Nikki Haley","Farmers are holding protests across Europe, clogging the streets with their tractors, blocking ports and pelting the European Parliament with eggs over a long list of complaints from environmental regulation to excessive red tape. “We are no longer making a living from our profession,” one aggrieved farmer in Paris told CNN. While some of the most dramatic protests have been in France, similar action has been taking place in a host of countries including Italy, Spain, Romania, Poland, Greece, Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands. Farming makes up just 1.4% of the European Union’s GDP, the latest figures show, but protests in Eastern Europe last year over cheap Ukrainian imports – which saw lengthy blockades at border crossings – show how farmers as a group are capable of causing major disruption. Both national governments and the EU are now under pressure to quell the fresh demonstrations. CNN takes a closer look at the factors involved. This week, the farmers’ protests struck at the heart of the European Union, when they rolled into Brussels on Thursday as leaders held a major summit on Ukraine. Once camped outside the parliament building, they lobbed eggs, blared their horns and sparked fires. Belgian farmers targeted border crossings with the Netherlands in Zandvliet, Meer and Postel, causing delays. In France, farmers blocked major highways leading to Paris as well as the cities of Lyon and Toulouse. Dozens of farmers set up tents and lit fires to keep themselves warm as they attempted to shut off routes into the French capital. At least 91 people were detained on Wednesday for obstructing traffic and causing damage near the Rungis market south of Paris, a key distribution food hub, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported. But other protesters were less hostile: Some farmers handed out freshly baked pain-au-chocolats to police outside Paris. One farmer, Hugo Auge, told CNN that the current system “makes a mockery of both farmers and consumers.” Also this week, tractors in Greece marched towards the second biggest city of Thessaloniki on Thursday, with the aim of blocking key routes inside the city. Images from Portugal showed long lines of trucks parked near the Spanish border. Last month, cities in Germany were brought to a standstill by thousands of rallying farmers braving freezing temperatures, piling misery on Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s governing coalition. Major road blockages stretched across cities from east to west including Hamburg, Cologne, Bremen, Nuremberg and Munich – with up to 2,000 tractors registered for each protest. The protests echo those of last year, when farmers in Eastern European countries, including Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, demonstrated against the impact of cheap Ukrainian grain imports, which were undercutting domestic prices and hitting the sales of local producers. While anger over economic, regulatory and green policies unites many of the protests, there are also grievances unique to each country. Farmers across the bloc say that the costs of energy, fertilizer and transport have risen, particularly in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine. On top of this, governments have been trying to reduce rising food prices amid inflation. Eurostat data shows that the prices farmers get for their agricultural products peaked in 2022 but has been declining since then – dropping nearly 9% on average between the third quarter of 2022 and the same period in 2023. In France, a government plan to phase out a tax break for farmers on diesel fuel, as part of a wider energy transition policy, has also sparked anger. Cheap foreign imports have fanned the flames of discontent, with farmers arguing that such products are unfair competition. Emmanuel Mathé, a French farmer from the small village of Noisy-Rudignon in Seine et Marne, told CNN: “We’re subject to enormous constraints and there are products coming in from outside Europe, that compete with us without having to apply the same rules that we’re obliged to in order to produce.” Farmers, particularly in Eastern Europe, continue to voice grievances over the cheap agricultural imports from Ukraine, including grain, sugar and meat. The EU has waived quotas and duties on Ukrainian imports in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Climate change is aggravating the situation in different ways. Extreme weather events such as wildfires and droughts are increasingly affecting production. Anger has also been directed at Brussels over the EU’s environmental targets. Renaud Foucart, a senior economics lecturer at Lancaster University in England, points to the European Green Deal as a major source of tension. The deal aims to introduce measures including a tax on carbon, pesticide bans, nitrogen emissions curbs and restrictions on water and land usage. Foucart says farmers are trying to postpone the regulations of the Green Deal for as long as possible. “So they want to further postpone any attempt to tax carbon, any attempt to reduce pesticides.” He points out that each European country has its own specific concerns. “In Germany, it was really focused on diesel, so starting to tax diesel for tractors. In the Netherlands, the specific problem was about the taxation of nitrogen, which affects the industrial production of pigs and chickens. Poland is a very interesting case because it has been at the forefront of military support for Ukraine, but at the same time the Polish farmers are very angry and blockading the border to make sure Ukrainian grain doesn’t arrive in Poland.” At the EU level, farmers won a compromise from Brussels on January 31, when a delay was announced to rules that would have required them to set aside land to encourage soil health and biodiversity. The European Commission offered an exemption to EU farmers from a requirement to keep a minimum share of their land fallow while allowing them to keep associated support payments. The Commission also said it would extend the suspension of import duties on Ukrainian exports for another year to June 2025. At a governmental level, Berlin has partially walked back on its plans to cut diesel subsidies last month. Watering down its original blueprint, the government said a car tax exemption for farming vehicles would be retained and cuts in diesel tax breaks would be staggered over three years. Many farmers however are calling for a complete reversal. Greece announced it would extend a special tax rebate on agricultural diesel by one year, in response to calls from farmers who had their crops and livestock lost in destructive flooding. France this week announced a series of measures for farmers in light of the protests. Newly appointed French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal pledged to safeguard “food sovereignty” and said that France would increase checks on food imports “that don’t respect our rules at a European and French level,” in an effort to protect farmers from unfair competition. Attal also announced the allocation of 150 million euros ($162 million) to livestock farmers “in tax and social support, starting this year and continuing on a permanent basis.” There are signs that the French measures are working – some blockades have been lifted after two major unions called for an end to the roadblocks. But elsewhere the protests continue. While governments have granted concessions, some farmers say they do not go far enough and are calling for continued action. The protests have also fueled backlash against the EU ahead of European Parliament elections in June. European Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen has championed the EU target of reaching net zero by 2050. However, she is facing pressure from her own center-right party to water down green legislation. European far-right parties are hoping to make gains in the elections and may capitalize on the farmers’ grievances for their own political gain. This has already been seen in Germany, when the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) involved itself in the protests and expressed solidarity with the farmers. And there is precedent for protesting farmers to do more than just take to the streets. In March last year, a Dutch populist party surfed a wave of rural anger to land a big election. The Farmer-Citizen Movement or BoerburgerBeweging (BBB) grew out of mass demonstrations against the government’s environmental policies. It is now the largest party in the Dutch senate.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/europe/europe-farmers-protests-explainer-intl/index.html,farmer holding protest across europe clogging street

24,At least 28 killed in strike on Russian-occupied town in eastern Ukraine,"Mesmerizing photos of ants firing acid, a shrimp floating over a rainbow-colored mosaic sea star, and a butterfly peering in at a wedding party are among the winning images of the Close-up Photographer of the Year 2023 competition. The contest, in its fifth year, celebrates micro and macro photography, striving to show the hidden wonders of the natural world, from microscopic fungi to majestic animals. Micro is the term used for taking photos of tiny subjects that require magnification, while macro involves capturing close-up images of larger subjects. Tracy Calder, co-founder of the competition and jury member, told CNN how the photos reveal unusual interactions between animals and plants, demonstrating how everything in the natural world is interconnected and interdependent. It “celebrates animals and behavior that people have never seen or encountered before,” she said. This year’s grand prize went to Hungarian photographer Csaba Daróczi, for his black and white image of a Eurasian nuthatch soaring through a forest. Taken with a GoPro from inside a hollowed-out tree stump, the striking image offers a new perspective of the bird against the backdrop of outstretched trees. The title of young close-up photographer of the year went to 17-year-old Spaniard Carlos Pérez Naval for his image of a Moorish gecko on a wall covered with pyrolusite crystals. “These magnesium minerals create stunning formations, which look just like petrified trees, but they are so small that they’re tricky to spot,” he said in a press release. “I wanted to capture a gecko in the ‘petrified forest’ for a long time, but they only recently appeared in my village – probably carried in fruit baskets from hotter areas. Due to climate change they can now survive here,” he added. The jury – made up of 23 photographers, scientists and naturalists – chose the winning photos for each category from a total of 12,000 entries from 67 countries. Many were taken in areas local to the photographers, showing the beauty of what can be seen in your own backyard, said Calder. She, along with her husband Daniel, founded the competition in 2018. Both are professional photographers. While many other photo awards feature close-up categories, they believed there was a need for an entire competition dedicated to macro and micro photography. “It’s often easier for people to get behind conservation stories featuring ‘cute’ or more obvious animals and plants: rhinos, pandas, orchids. But the lesser-known insects and plants we often consider weeds have a huge role to play in keeping everything balanced. Close-up photography often showcases these animals and plants,” she said. “There’s also a joy in showing people things they wouldn’t be able to see without a macro lens or microscope. Many of the creatures and plants we show are all around us but are never noticed. The competition is a way for them to be noticed,” she added.",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/close-up-photographer-of-the-year-scn-c2e-spc-intl/index.html,mesmerizing photo ant firing acid shrimp floating rainbowcolored mosaic sea star butterfly peering wedding party among winning image closeup photographer year two thousand and twenty-three competition contest fifth year celebrates micro macro photography striving show hidden wonder natural world microscopic fungi majestic animal micro term used taking photo tiny subject require magnification macro involves capturing closeup image larger subject tracy calder cofounder competition jury member told cnn photo reveal unusual interaction animal plant demonstrating everything natural world interconnected interdependent “ celebrates animal behavior people never seen encountered ” said year ’ grand prize went hungarian photographer csaba daróczi black white image eurasian nuthatch soaring forest taken gopro inside hollowedout tree stump striking image offer new perspective bird backdrop outstretched tree title young closeup photographer year went 17yearold spaniard carlos pérez naval image moorish gecko wall covered pyrolusite crystal “ magnesium mineral create stunning formation look like petrified tree small ’ tricky spot ” said press release “ wanted capture gecko ‘ petrified forest ’ long time recently appeared village – probably carried fruit basket hotter area due climate change survive ” added jury – made twenty-three photographer scientist naturalist – chose winning photo category total twelve thousand entry sixty-seven country many taken area local photographer showing beauty seen backyard said calder along husband daniel founded competition two thousand and eighteen professional photographer many photo award feature closeup category believed need entire competition dedicated macro micro photography “ ’ often easier people get behind conservation story featuring ‘ cute ’ obvious animal plant rhino panda orchid lesserknown insect plant often consider weed huge role play keeping everything balanced closeup photography often showcase animal plant ” said “ ’ also joy showing people thing ’ able see without macro lens microscope many creature plant show around u never noticed competition way noticed ” added,2
25,"Fareed: In responding to Iran, the US should take ‘The Godfather’s’ advice","When wildfire ripped through Hawaii’s Maui last August, the impact was devastating: a whole town reduced to ashes, more than 100 lives lost. The inferno was described as the “largest natural disaster in state history.” But some on Instagram suggested, without evidence, there was something much more nefarious at play. Wellness influencer @truth_crunchy_mama told her 37,000 followers to “stop blaming things on nature that were actually caused by the government.” They’re “going to keep setting wildfires until we all submit to their climate change agenda,” she said in another post. Health influencer @drmercola suggested to his 504,000 followers whether, while the media focused on climate change, the fires might have been deliberately set to “to facilitate a land grab” to make the area a “smart city” — referring to a technology-focused urban design idea. A natural parenting influencer, whose Instagram page is filled with soft-focus pictures of herself against pretty pastel backgrounds, inferred to her 76,000-strong community that Hawaii’s wildfires were started by “directed energy weapons” — systems which use energy such as laser beams. These posters are all wellness influencers — a loosely-defined umbrella term for a wide range of accounts including yoga, lifestyle, fitness, alternative health and new age spirituality. While conspiracy theories about the Hawaii wildfires spread across the internet last year, it may seem surprising they were also seized upon by part of the wellness community. But for years there has been a merging of wellness, disinformation and conspiracy, as a subset of influencers use the backdrop of aesthetically pleasing, pastel-colored posts to spread much darker messages, weaving together alarming conspiracy theories with calls for users to buy their supplements or services. This phenomenon exploded during the pandemic, when anti-vax sentiment took hold in large parts of the wellness community. As interest in the pandemic waned, experts say some wellness influencers have latched on to climate change to galvanize followers. Their concern: Those influencers — some with hundreds of thousands of followers — are exposing new, and younger, audiences to a slew of misinformation and undermining efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Cécile Simmons, a trained yoga teacher, was surprised when many of the wellness accounts she followed started posting about climate change. “It just started popping up in my feed and I thought OK, that’s interesting, now that COVID is ‘over’ they’re diversifying the narrative,” she told CNN. Simmons, also a researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a UK-based think tank focused on disinformation, started digging. She pored over more than 150 wellness accounts, most of which had between 10,000 to 100,000 followers. All offered wellness advice, sold related products and promoted some form of misinformation. The claims Simmons found were sweeping and varied, ranging from outright climate denial to attempts to undermine climate solutions by portraying them as part of a global plot for control. Some focused on deadly extreme weather events, saying they were orchestrated by the government, or that malign global forces were modifying the weather. Others claimed climate policies were a plot to control people’s lives, bodies and diets. A small section of new age accounts asserted that climate change was the result of a disconnection with forces in the universe. Rejecting climate action may seem counterintuitive for wellness influencers, who often focus on nature or evoke bucolic visions of the past. But when you have insight into this world, it tracks, Simmons said. A strong thread of individualism runs through wellness accounts, alongside a deep distrust of authorities. “They emphasize individual solutions to collective problems, and they sell wellness as a response to climate anxiety,” she said. Many of these influencers maintain they are merely speaking truth to power. It’s a theme of @truth_crunchy_mama account, who calls herself a “truth teller.” The person who runs the account did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Some even say they accept the human-caused climate crisis. Joseph Mercola, the man behind the @drmercola Instagram account, told CNN that “humans are absolutely impacting the environment and the climate.” When asked about his comments on Hawaii’s wildfires, he said he accepts the consensus that dry conditions and strong winds fueled the blaze. “It was never stated that it was definitely intentional,” he said, “although some have speculated that is a possibility.” His climate posts are often framed in this way, not making definitive claims but rather asking questions like: Is the idea of eating insects “part of globalists’ ‘green agenda?’” Or advertising guest posts suggesting the “war on climate change” follows “the same playbook used by nefarious individuals who lust for complete power over the citizens.” The wellness industry, depending on how its defined, is worth anything from many billions to trillions of dollars — $5.6 trillion, according to a recent report from industry group The Global Wellness Institute. And it’s been decades in the making. Its modern incarnation goes back to the late 1950s, said Stephanie Alice Baker, who researches health and wellness cultures at City University in the UK. American doctor Halbert L. Dunn started to popularize the idea that health was more than simply the absence of disease; instead “peak wellness” meant also finding purpose and meaning. The movement gained traction around the 1970s, then with the internet, came the entrepreneurs and influencers. Wellness has now come to mean almost anything, said Baker, but at its core it revolves around ideas of individualism, self-enlightenment and distrust of institutions — a near-perfect breeding ground for conspiracy theories to flourish. “I don’t think the culture understood how dangerous the rhetoric in wellness spaces was until the pandemic,” said Derek Beres, co-host of the podcast Conspirituality, which explores the collision between wellness and conspiracy theories. One researcher, Marc-André Argentino, coined the term “pastel QAnon,” to describe the soft, pleasing aesthetic used by some influencers to spread their conspiratorial worldview. This conspiracy thinking “usually bubbles up during times of cultural confusion or tragedy,” Beres told CNN. Covid-19 provided one of these inflection points, climate change is now providing another. Influencers crave relevance, said Callum Hood, head of research at the Center for Countering Digital Hate, and “climate change is a big relevant issue that’s in the news all the time.” It is a short ideological leap from vaccine conspiracies to climate conspiracies, Hood told CNN: If the establishment is wrong about health, the thinking goes, then they’re also lying to you about climate change. Misinformation expert Tim Caulfield, a professor of health law and policy at the University of Alberta, said many wellness influencers are now expected to present a basket of beliefs that the community wants to hear. “Being anti-climate change becomes part of being on that team” and a way to “turbocharge your audience,” he added. It may seem easy to dismiss this subsection of wellness influencers, but the bonds they create with followers are strong. They are particularly good at creating intimacy, because they focus on people’s bodies and direct experience of the world, said Baker. It forges a strong parasocial  — or one-sided — connection, where followers believe they have a personal relationship with the influencer. Many project authenticity and present themselves as outside the system, able to speak truth to power, she added. The appeal of their conspiracy messages is clear, especially with a complex issue like climate change. It is a salve to anxiety and a chance to reclaim agency. “Once you find the conspiracy theory, it all collapses, it all becomes simplified. ‘There’s a bad guy who’s lying to you,’” CCDH’s Hood said. The anger fuels engagement, but how this translates to real-world impact is notoriously hard to pin down. Still, many experts think there is a significant effect. Climate misinformation is having “a profound impact” both on people’s beliefs and on the normalization of fringe perspectives, Caulfield said. Not only does it undermine climate solutions, it also depoliticizes people, sowing distrust in climate policies. It’s particularly worrying as it allows climate misinformation to reach new audiences, experts say, including young people that might otherwise be supportive of climate change action. Studies suggest younger generations are getting the majority of their news from platforms like Instagram, said Mariah Wellman, an assistant professor and wellness expert at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “If the only news they’re consuming is coming from a wellness influencer sharing disinformation regarding climate change, they may never realize the information they’ve been given is inaccurate,” Wellman told CNN. Extreme views can give influencers higher clicks, more audience and a more lucrative brand, Caulfield said, so the incentive is clear to steer towards those ideologies. “And the sad thing is that, the more it becomes about ideology, the harder it is to change people’s minds, because it is about belonging to a community.” There are strategies to counter the misinformation, though. It’s important to do it in a respectful and constructive way, even when it comes from influencers some may dismiss as “frivolous,” Caulfield said. “Pre-bunking” can also help, he added — getting out ahead of the misinformation, and making people aware of the tactics used to push it. For others, the focus is much more on the other platforms hosting these influencers. Hood is pushing for more clarity on climate policies, and for measures including bans on amplifying and monetizing content that clearly contradicts climate science. He also called on regulators to take a hard look at the products and services being sold on Instagram and other platforms. “It is the Wild West,” he said. Meta, which owns Instagram, declined to comment. The company has policies to counter misinformation, including international teams of fact checkers which evaluate climate science content. When they rate posts as false, they can reduce distribution and add warning labels, and accounts that repeatedly offend can lose the ability to advertise or monetize. But for experts like Hood, there is simply not enough being done to tackle a problem with such alarming implications. As the climate crisis continues to fuel more frequent and more severe extreme weather events, it is creating perfect conditions for climate denial and misinformation to flourish across these parts of the wellness community. “The dark side of wellness has always been there. It’s just now we see it,” Simmons said.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/climate/wellness-influencers-conspiracy-climate-intl/index.html,wildfire ripped hawaii ’ maui last august impact devastating

26,Worker pays out $25 million after video call with deepfake ‘chief financial officer’,"After 11 previous seasons spread over 24 years, the final run of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” feels like an occasion but really isn’t, in the way a show that actually built toward something, like “Lost” or “Game of Thrones” was. Mostly, Larry David’s extended swan-song provides a final chance to watch him and his pals carry on like idiots, feeling a little more hit-miss in the execution. As with earlier seasons (“The Producers” run being a prime example), there is an ongoing through-line to the events of Season 12, with Larry becoming celebrated for an inadvertent action, a ruse he struggles to maintain while still enjoying the opportunity to bask in the glory. The show also fields a particularly impressive assortment of celebrity cameos as, naturally, themselves, over the course of the nine episodes previewed, with HBO asking critics to keep the bigger names under wraps. Ultimately, though, “Curb” always comes back to Larry being Larry, and dealing with the fact, as he describes himself, that he is “A person who hates people and yet had to be amongst them.” He also spends most of the time with his near-equally-eccentric friends and frenemies, including Jeff (Jeff Garlin, who David has stood by, despite allegations regarding his on-set behavior that led to his awkward exit from “The Goldbergs”), Susie (Susie Essman) and Leon (J.B. Smoove), as well as an extended circle of Richard Lewis, Ted Danson and Larry’s ex-wife Cheryl (Cheryl Hines, who has become more controversial since her husband, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., began running for president). Tracey Ullman also lingers as the girlfriend that Larry doesn’t really like but with whom he can’t break up, since she’s undergoing addiction recovery and, he’s told, such an event might be a significant setback to her progress. Chalk it up, perhaps, to everyone being a little older than when last we saw them, but much of this season feels more tired, or perhaps just familiar, in an “Old Man yells at cloud” (or in Larry’s case, Siri) kind of way. That said, there are still explosively funny moments, underscoring David’s knack for identifying the absurd and a prevailing attitude that has long since made clear he doesn’t care who he might offend, but rather mischievously revels in it. Indeed, there’s a popular meme on the platform formerly known as Twitter that features David saying, more crudely, “Nobody cares.” One of the defining aspects of “Curb” has been that its creator and star came to the show after having become hugely wealthy thanks to “Seinfeld,” allowing him to produce episodes when and how he wanted to do them, an arrangement that HBO has honored for a quarter-century. That unique dynamic alone has made “Curb” a fascinating experiment, which has lasted far longer than even David probably could have envisioned. Even with all that creative freedom, given David’s quirks, real and imagined, its longevity is frankly remarkable. So whatever the final episodes hold, this much appears certain: Nobody can say “Curb” signed off prematurely; and Larry David will be leaving on his, and only his, terms, at which point he can get back to being one of those people who hate people however much he wants. “Curb Your Enthusiasm” begins its 12th and final season February 4 at 10 p.m. ET on HBO, which, like CNN, is a unit of Warner Bros.

27,More than 100 killed by raging wildfires in Chile as authorities warn toll will rise,"Just over a century ago – 1923 to be precise – a crumbling, ancient city in the middle of Turkey found itself catapulted into international prominence as the world around it reeled from years of conflict. While Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople, had long been the country’s seat of power, the collapse of the Ottoman empire led to the dawn of a new era for Turkey and that meant a new capital. Ankara. Located in the center of the country, Ankara dates back well before Roman times, but as the heart of the newly established Turkish Republic it was soon to become the country’s city of the future. That meant a radical building plan and equally radical expansion as the city grew into an industrial and administrative powerhouse that is now home to more than 5 million people. Today, in tourism terms at least, Ankara still lives in the shadow of Istanbul – often unfairly dismissed as a gray, bureaucratic and boring destination. In reality, it’s a fascinating city. Ankara is quieter, greener, more organized, more livable – a confluence of its history and the youthful energy of its large student population. It’s a city with its own colorful identity, Ankara’s big leap into bold modernity came when a new city plan was created in 1932 by German architect and urban planner Hermann Jansen. The city was given a majestic central boulevard, Atatürk Bulvarı – named after Turkish Republic founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk – and soon European and US-influenced structures began to sprout along it, as well as brand-new cafes and restaurants in the same modern styles. In 1948, the Ankara State Opera and Ballet was inaugurated, reflecting the new country’s beliefs that the arts were the ultimate representation of modernity. Originally built in 1933 as an exhibition hall, it was turned into a performing space by German architect Paul Bonatz. The large, curving structure with an elegant columned interior continues to host opera, ballets and concerts. The building work continued. Vital government structures like the astoundingly imposing Turkish Grand National Assembly, Ministry of Defense and Çankaya Mansion (the official residence of the vice president), among others, were designed by the Austrian architect Clemens Holzmeister. And, between 1961 and 1980, the city obtained one of its most important university campuses, the Middle East Technical University, one of Turkey’s key works of Brutalist architecture - the modernist style that uses exposed concrete or brick - designed by Behruz and Altuğ Çinici. Nowadays, the remnants of this nation-building project can still be felt in the architecture of Ankara, its masterplan, its museums, universities and art centers. And it has continued to grow, cementing its own identity far away from the glamour of Istanbul. One of Ankara’s most important and well-known sites is Anıtkabir, the imposing marble and travertine mausoleum of Atatürk. But the city’s most-visited quarter is around Ankara Castle, the seventh-century fortification perched on a hill overlooking the Kale neighborhood’s colorful Ottoman-era houses. Here, the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations contains collections of artefacts from important archeological sites of the surrounding Anatolia region. Next door, the newly established Erimtan Archaeology and Arts Museum has three beautifully renovated historic Ankara houses that exhibit 2,000 works from the Roman, Urartu, Hittite and Byzantine ages. Just a few steps away, Divan Çukurhan – an elegant hotel inside a lovingly restored 16th-century caravanserai - is the place for visitors to take a Turkish coffee and dessert break while lounging on leather sofas in the building’s main arcade. Outside, the many descending cobblestoned streets of Ankara’s historic Samanpazarı quarter are filled with ateliers and shops selling crafts and antiques. An abundance of handmade goods can be found on display outside every vendor, as well as historic caravanserais with artisan shops such as the Tarihi Pilavoğlu Han Çarşısı. A hidden highlight among the antique and artisan shops here is the Aslanhane Cami, one of Ankara’s oldest mosques, which was recently included in the UNESCO List of Wooden Hypostyle Mosques of Medieval Anatolia. The mosque’s most important element is the ornate wood carving found on the ceiling, mihrab and minbar, a minute weave of floral and geometric patterns. The Ankara Ethnography Museum, the new republic’s first museum built between 1925-1928 by Turkish architect Arif Hikmet Koyunoğlu, exudes a style heavily influenced by the regal Ottoman aesthetic. The exhibition inside includes colorful folk costumes from all over Anatolia, and intricate Ottoman calligraphy and Turkish tile and glass art. Next door, the Ankara Painting and Sculpture Museum is another thing of exceptional beauty. It was built between 1927-1930, also by Koyunoğlu, in the same regal style of towering and ornamental marble details. Inside, beneath antique chandeliers and ornate ceilings, more than 150 years of Turkish art is on display. About a 20-minute walk away, and past the city’s Gençlik Parkı, the façade of the İş Bankası İktisadi Bağımsızlık Müzesi (İşbank Economic Independence Museum) is impossible to overlook. The four-story building, with its lancet arches and floral ornaments, was designed by Italian architect Guilio Mongeri in 1929 and includes an oval stained-glass ceiling in the main hall depicting mythological deity Hermes. The city’s main hub for contemporary art is Cer Modern, founded in 2010 inside a former railway workshop (“Cer” refers to a locomotive train). Hosting exhibitions both inside the vast halls and outside in its art garden, the gallery also organizes workshops and film screenings and has its own café. With so much imposing architecture and, let’s face it, bureaucracy, it’s little wonder that Ankara has something of a monochrome reputation in the wider world. But those who know it well say it’s misunderstood. Ragip Soylu, a journalist who moved from Washington to Ankara in 2019, has been charting his affection for the city’s visual splendors on Instagram since 2020 via the account Ankara Gri Değil (Ankara is not Gray). “People usually go to Ankara for bureaucratic affairs whether it’s an exam, visa application or a job related to the judiciary… and so they end up seeing the city from this gray perspective,” says Soylu, the Ankara bureau chief for the Middle East Eye news website. “For me what makes Ankara special is that it’s an orderly and more peaceful place with less traffic, less crowds, lower inflation than other big cities… While it has become impossible to live in Istanbul, it is quite possible in Ankara. In every sense,” he says. “There are many places I like in Ankara. Watching the exhibitions and talks at Ka Atölye; discovering the architectural and cultural heritage in different parts of the city with Urban Walks Ankara; listening to a classical music concert at CSO Ada; having breakfast at Kakule Fırın and Sarnii; eating pizza at Mozz Pizza; and enjoying döner kebab from a female chef at Kebapçı Canbolat.” Soylu, who often compares Ankara to Washington, also recommends discovering the historic Ankara houses of the Hamamönü neighborhood, the new third-wave coffee shops in Bahçelievler, and enjoying the view from Atakule, a notable tower belonging to the city’s first modern mall, originally built in 1989. There are sights to enjoy nearby too. Thanks to the high-speed Turkish Railways train system, the ride to the nearby university town of Eskişehir has become one of the most popular weekend getaways for Ankara residents. Touted as one of Turkey’s most European towns, Eskişehir is also famous for the Odunpazarı Historical Urban Site, an open-air museum, which showcases some of the best-preserved examples of traditional Turkish architecture. The site is also home to the Atlıhan Crafts Bazaar, where the production, display and sale of traditional handicrafts are preserved as well as the world’s only meerschaum (sepiolite) museum – known as lületaşı in Turkish. Since 2019, Eskişehir has also become a prime destination to visit the OMM (Odunpazarı Modern Museum) designed by the internationally acclaimed Japanese architecture firm Kengo Kuma and Associates. Housing the modern art collection of architect and contractor Erol Tabanca, the impressive structure composed of stacked and interlocking timber beams is one of the country’s most imposing modern museums. Right next door, the OMM Inn is a modern boutique hotel inside a renovated Ottoman-era Odunpazarı house with its own café and restaurant – featuring an innovative menu free of any animal products – as well as a shop selling eco-friendly and sustainable goods.",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/ankara-turkey/index.html,"century ago – one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-three precise – crumbling

28,Why this is ‘the most dreaded bit of ocean on the globe’,"Tens of thousands of people in China are flocking to the social media account of the US Embassy in Beijing to vent their anger and frustration with the continuing meltdown in the country’s stock market. On Monday, mainland Chinese markets slumped again after their worst weeks in years. The Shanghai Composite Index briefly fell more than 3%, hitting its lowest level in five years. It had pared some losses by noon, but is still down 1.8%. Last week, the index fell 6.2%, its biggest weekly loss since October 2018. The Shenzhen Component Index also tumbled 2.3% in morning trade, following a 8.1% slide last week. More than 1,700 stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets slumped more than 10% Monday. Under a Friday post by the US Embassy’s Weibo account about protecting wild giraffes, many Chinese people complained about the stock market rout and the challenging economy. “The US government, please help Chinese stock investors,” a user said in a repost of the animal protection article. “I love America! Please help Chinese people,” another user said. Many posts later appeared to be scrubbed by censors, as the authorities intensify their censorship of criticism about China’s stalled economy. Investors seemed to have shrugged off Chinese regulators’ latest pledge to bolster the stock market. On Sunday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission vowed to prevent “abnormal fluctuations” in the stock market and stabilize confidence. But it did not offer any details about how it would do so. Altogether, about $6 trillion in market value has been wiped out from the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets over the past three years, according to a CNN calculation based on data from the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong exchanges. A record downturn in its dominant real estate market, high youth unemployment, deflation and a rapidly falling birthrate are just some of the issues ailing the world’s second-largest economy.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/05/investing/china-stock-market-plunge-us-embassy-weibo-hnk-intl/index.html,"ten thousand people china flocking social medium account u embassy beijing vent anger frustration continuing meltdown country ’ stock market monday mainland chinese market slumped worst week year shanghai composite index briefly fell three hitting lowest level five year pared loss noon still eighteen last week index fell sixty-two biggest weekly loss since october two thousand and eighteen shenzhen component index also tumbled twenty-three morning trade following eighty-one slide last week one thousand, seven hundred stock shanghai shenzhen market slumped ten monday friday post u embassy ’ weibo account protecting wild giraffe many chinese people complained stock market rout challenging economy “ u government please help chinese stock investor ” user said repost animal protection article “ love america please help chinese people ” another user said many post later appeared scrubbed censor authority intensify censorship criticism china ’ stalled economy investor seemed shrugged chinese regulator ’ latest pledge bolster stock market sunday china security regulatory commission vowed prevent “ abnormal fluctuation ” stock market stabilize confidence offer detail would altogether six trillion market value wiped chinese hong kong stock market past three year according cnn calculation based data shanghai shenzhen hong kong exchange record downturn dominant real estate market high youth unemployment deflation rapidly falling birthrate issue ailing world ’ secondlargest economy",9
29,Trump suggests he would consider a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if reelected,"Special counsel Jack Smith’s office is defending how the federal government during Joe Biden’s presidency sought to repossess White House records Donald Trump took, and how the case evolved into a federal investigation. The expansive, 67-page filing offers a detailed retelling of the standoff with Trump as a way to “set the record straight,” Smith’s prosecutors say, on the origins of the Mar-a-Lago documents case, as they fight to keep the case on track for a spring trial. After the search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida estate, in August 2022, federal investigators pursued a “careful and thorough investigation,” seeking information from intelligence agencies, the National Archives and other parts of the federal government before bringing criminal charges against Trump for mishandling documents, the special counsel’s office said. The prosecutors say Trump’s legal team has attempted to distort the events in his favor – including by claiming he had a security clearance that extended past his presidency. He is seeking to convince a federal judge in Florida to force the Justice Department to give him more documents as evidence in the case from several sensitive parts of the federal government, including the Biden White House, the Department of Energy and the US intelligence community. Prosecutors’ retelling of the investigation on Friday is based on documents they’ve turned over to Trump’s legal team already that may be used as evidence in the upcoming trial against him, according to the filing. “Federal agencies confronted, and appropriately responded to, an extraordinary situation resulting entirely from the defendants’ conduct,” the prosecutors wrote. “The law required that those documents be collected,” the prosecutors also said in the filing. The dispute of what happened dates to the end of the Trump presidency and early days of the Biden White House, when it became clear to federal government agencies and to Trump’s representatives that boxes of presidential documents were missing. Specifically, prosecutors say then-White House lawyer Jonathan Su, who worked under Biden, spoke with Trump aides who handled his presidential records post-presidency and with the National Archives, at a time when the groups had to coordinate discussions about missing presidential records. Trump has tried to claim Su’s involvement – and the role of his successor’s White House in discussions about his presidential records – was improper. But the prosecutors on Friday wrote Trump’s team “not only knew” of the Biden White House being part of the discussion, they also approved of it. “The White House Counsel’s Office became involved because of the need to consult its personnel about missing Trump Administration Presidential records,” the prosecutors wrote on Friday. Later, in early 2022, when presidential records from Trump’s White House were shipped back to the National Archives, archivists found classified records among them, prompting them to contact the Justice Department to begin a criminal investigation. Trump has taken issue with how the DOJ handled the investigation and has accused various agencies of working together to smear him after he left the presidency. On Friday, the special counsel’s office argued the case’s evolution followed Justice Department protocol, including in how White House employees spoke with DOJ officials. “The record shows only different government agencies, with specific portfolios and responsibilities, at work to solve an increasingly vexing and concerning problem,” prosecutors said. “The defendants’ legal problems are solely of their own making.” Smith’s team said that they scoured all records and found no evidence Trump held security clearance after he left office, despite his attorneys claiming he did. Trump’s attorneys have argued that the former president held the security clearance from the Department of Energy – which works with the nation’s nuclear arsenal – after he left office, which, they said, could support an argument that Trump was acting in a good faith and “non-criminal states of mind relating to possession of classified materials” in Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors produced a memorandum from the assistant general counsel in Department of Energy, which stated that Trump did have a high security clearance, called Q clearance, in connection with his “duties” as president, but that “Trump’s clearance had terminated upon the end of his presidency.” Trump’s name was inadvertently left on the DOE database as having the Q clearance after his term ended, the general counsel wrote in their memo, and was “belatedly updated to reflect that reality” when DOE officials learned of the mistake. “But even if Trump’s Q clearance had remained active, that fact would not give him the right to take any documents containing information subject to the clearance to his home and store it in his basement or anywhere else at Mar-a-Lago,” prosecutors wrote. “No Q clearance holder has authorization to remove documents from a proper place of storage and keep them for himself. And a Q clearance would not even permit access to, much less offsite possession of, the documents charged in Counts 1-18 and 20-32.” Additionally, prosecutors produced search results from the Scattered Castles database, which records the security clearances maintained by the Intelligence Community, and from Department of Defense databases. Prosecutors wrote that their searches “yielded no past or present security clearances for Trump.” The documents are among more than 1.28 million pages of unclassified discovery that prosecutors have given Trump’s defense lawyers in the classified documents case. Those documents include key records from their investigation, security footage from Mar-a-Lago, information that defense lawyers could use to impeach potential trial witnesses, and records about “secured facilities that could be used to accommodate access to classified information at properties associated with Trump during his presidency.” The special counsel’s team has also turned over a significant amount of information on the search at Mar-a-Lago on August 8, 2022. That information, prosecutors wrote, includes the FBI operations plan for the search, chain of custody reports and descriptions of evidence seized, CCTV footage from the day of the search, communications obtained from Trump Organization and Mar-a-Lago employees from that day, photographs taken during the search, inventories of the documents found at the property, and the documents that the FBI seized. Defense lawyers have access to a significant amount of Secret Service records, according to prosecutors, including plans for enhanced security at Mar-a-Lago, records of security breaches at Mar-a-Lago and the fact that “approximately 48,000 guests who visited Mar-a-Lago between January 2021 and May 2022, while classified documents were at the property,” but only “2,200 had their names checked and only 2,900 passed through magnetometers.” Additionally, prosecutors turned over “all discoverable material from (the National Archives) within its possession” and “all discoverable material stemming from the investigating agents’ contacts with FBI Headquarters.” In their filing, prosecutors argue that Trump and his co-defendants in the case are not entitled to the internal government communications the former president is seeking as part of discovery, which, they say, are protected by law as work products of the team of prosecutors. Trump’s attorneys, in a filing in mid-January, sought access to Biden-era White House records and records from the Intelligence Community, arguing that Biden’s administration “took steps to create a false appearance of separation from the investigation.” Prosecutors, however, shot back, saying that much of the specific requests from Trump’s team “seek evidence from agencies – including NARA, the White House, and the Intelligence Community – that are not part of the prosecution team.” They added: “No personnel from the National Security Council, the White House Counsel’s Office, the Office of Records Management, or any other White House component participated in any interviews (except as witnesses), presented the case to the grand jury, accompanied prosecutors to any court proceedings, or played any role in the development of prosecutorial strategy.” Additionally, the Intelligence Community “played no investigatory role in this case,” the filing says, and were therefore not part of the prosecution team. Smith’s team also says that some of the evidence Trump is looking for either does not exist or isn’t in prosecutor’s possession. According to the filing, there has not been any communication between prosecutors and Biden or senior White House political officials either about the investigation or otherwise. “To be clear, the defendants’ requests are predicated on a false narrative,” prosecutors wrote of Trump’s claims that the Justice Department is targeting him for political purposes. Prosecutors continued: “The investigation and prosecution of this case have been appropriately driven by the facts and the law, not by any form of political bias.” Smith’s team argued that Trump should also not be allowed to use this claim of selective prosecution as part of his defense at trial because it’s an issue for the judge to decide, not a jury. “The well-settled proposition,” prosecutors wrote, is “that selective-prosecution claims have no place at trial.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/jack-smith-defends-mar-a-lago-search-case/index.html,"special counsel

30,Pigeon suspected of spying for China released in India after animal rights group steps in,"Wednesday’s emotional Senate Judiciary Committee hearing grilling tech CEOs focused on Silicon Valley’s failures to protect kids online. But it also spotlighted Congress’ own glaring — and longstanding — inability to pass any meaningful legislation to rein in tech platforms. According to more than a half-dozen front-line participants in the battle to regulate tech, the gridlock boils down to three main factors: Lobbying and partisanship, genuine disagreements over hugely consequential questions about the future of privacy and free speech, and who technology is meant to serve in the first place. Big Tech has become a bipartisan punching bag on Capitol Hill. But US lawmakers have sat by while consumer advocates, whistleblowers and state attorneys general have amassed troves of evidence suggesting tech giants may have endangered users’ health or monopolized key sectors of the economy. Tech companies spend millions in Washington to get their way. This has been true since the early 2010s, when tech companies began realizing the benefits of influencing policymakers on issues including net neutrality and privacy. As with other industries, Big Tech’s influence machine involves campaign contributions to members of Congress, as well as the hiring of registered lobbyists to gain exclusive access to lawmakers. But it also includes a wide and sophisticated network of think tanks, advocacy groups and trade associations that are now a basic feature of the legislative process. “They use the same playbook that the tobacco companies used, that the fossil-fuel industry has used,” said Danny Weiss, chief advocacy officer at Common Sense Media, a consumer advocacy group. “So that’s all real and that’s definitely formidable.” Lobbying is not inherently bad in a democracy that gives everyone a voice, advocates on both sides say. But the tech industry’s deep pockets give it a distinct advantage. Sometimes, differences between tech companies can create openings to sow chaos. This week, Microsoft announced its support for the Kids Online Safety Act, a leading social media bill. But Microsoft has only a small stake in social media with its ownership of LinkedIn, so its commitment stands to make life far more difficult for rivals such as Google, which owns YouTube, while minimizing the impact to itself. Tech analyst Ben Thompson has called this phenomenon a “strategy credit.” “It’s cost-less for Microsoft to embrace KOSA,” said Adam Kovacevich, founder of the tech advocacy group Chamber of Progress and a former Google policy director. “That’s not their business … their business is business software.” Occasionally, the machine springs into action to defeat specific legislation. In 2022, for example, industry advocates spent tens of millions of dollars on advertising against a landmark antitrust bill that would’ve forced sweeping changes to US app stores. Although the legislation cleared a key committee, it was never brought to the Senate floor and hasn’t budged since. Apart from the pressure outside groups bring to bear, lawmakers’ own conflicting priorities and incentives can make legislating difficult. For years, Republican stonewalling has made it almost impossible for Congress to perform even basic functions such as passing budgets and raising the debt ceiling, let alone approve sweeping tech regulation. GOP infighting, particularly at the committee level, has been driving more recent deadlock on social media legislation in the House, said a child safety advocate who has met with multiple lawmakers’ offices. Many lawmakers are vain and would prefer not to allow other colleagues to claim credit for progress on an issue, the advocate said, requesting anonymity to describe closed-door conversations. Weiss and Kovacevich both agreed that pride can be a significant barrier to getting things done. “A lot of times,” Kovacevich said, “one of the dynamics behind the scenes is that senators often say, ‘I’m not going to let that rival bill move unless my bill moves.’ And I think that’s an underappreciated reason for why legislation doesn’t happen.” “Ego is to Washington as sunshine is to a day at the beach,” Weiss said. Also responsible are congressional leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer or House Speaker Mike Johnson, who play important roles in setting the legislative agenda. In the past, Schumer has said he will only allow Senate floor votes on bills that have a firm 60 votes to pass and avoid a filibuster. And that can be a significant obstacle for bills that lack enough of the right support. “You don’t bring up bills where you know you’re going to lose the vote,” said Weiss, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s chief of staff from 2017 to 2019. “That is not leadership.” A Schumer spokesperson told CNN Thursday that children’s online safety legislation is a priority for the majority leader. “While we work to pass the supplemental and keep the government funded in the coming weeks, Leader Schumer will continue to work with the sponsors of the online safety bills to ensure the necessary support,” the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for Johnson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawmakers and consumer advocates alike say it is past time for new laws holding tech companies accountable. But what that means in practice is far squishier. Even when lawmakers can agree on what the problem is, they often disagree on how to solve it, creating a smorgasbord of half a dozen or more social media bills floating around Congress. A key example of this dynamic is what to do about Section 230, the federal immunity law that protects companies from lawsuits over user content or content moderation decisions. While plaintiffs may attempt to sue the platforms, Section 230 lets companies ask judges to toss out the suits at an early stage, and courts have interpreted the law to provide broad liability protections to all websites. Members of both parties have villainized Section 230 but for different reasons: Conservatives say it lets social media companies censor right-wing views with impunity, while Democrats say it blocks accountability for the spread of hate speech, election lies and health misinformation. Because the two parties come at the issue from opposite perspectives, so do their policy prescriptions — creating a fundamental inability to reconcile. Other bills ask the public to make difficult tradeoffs, such as giving law enforcement greater power to surveil US citizens in the name of protecting kids online — or giving attorneys general the power to decide what content is too dangerous to show to kids, which LGBTQ advocates warn could be abused to target them. Some proposals simply cannot pass due to possible constitutional risks, said Stephen Balkam, founder of the Family Online Safety Institute. Unlike other countries that lack First Amendment protections for speech, the United States cannot pass laws forcing tech platforms to “speak” in certain ways and cannot restrict Americans from accessing lawful content, even if it may be distasteful or objectionable. “There’s an awful lot of legislation that just simply can’t pass constitutional muster,” he said. “Part of the problem is that solutions that sound straightforward, like ‘just censor all the bad content,’ are more appealing as sound bites for TV than actual, thoughtful regulations,” said Evan Greer, director of Fight for the Future, a digital rights advocacy group. Tech companies and consumer groups do agree on one thing: Congress should pass a national privacy law regulating how consumer data can be collected, used and shared. That would be a huge down payment on a future social media law, said Balkam. But even that proposal is still subject to many of the same dynamics that make social media regulation hard.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/tech/social-media-regulation-bipartisan-support/index.html,wednesday ’ emotional senate judiciary committee hearing grilling tech ceo focused silicon valley ’

31,Nikki Haley is right about the Trump tariffs,"South Africa is home to some of the most luxurious, nostalgic train journeys on offer anywhere in the world. But for certain enthusiasts, a train going nowhere is the country’s star attraction. Kruger Shalati: The Train on the Bridge is a hotel in Skukuza in Kruger National Park, one of Africa’s largest game reserves and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Comprising a set of train carriages renovated into 24 modern suites with balconies and a pool overlooking the Sabie River, it marries luxury accommodation with an intimate view of wildlife, including sightings of Africa’s “Big Five” — lions, leopards, rhinos, elephants and buffalos. Jerry Mabena, CEO of Motsamayi Tourism Group, which owns the hotel, says the venture harks back to the earliest days of the park, when steam trains would pass through Kruger in the 1920s on the Selati Railway Line. Trains were once vital for tourists accessing Kruger, and would even park overnight on the same bridge where the hotel sits today. A new railway line built on the edge of Kruger in the 1970s pushed the Selati line and bridge into retirement, but in 2016 an idea was formed to restore the bridge to its former glory. “The idea for us was to re-enact the experience in some form or another,” Mabena says. “When we had the opportunity to buy mothballed old carriages from Transnet — which is our rail logistics operator in South Africa — we couldn’t say no to the idea.” The carriages’ interiors have been renovated with a modern finish, albeit with a few Art Deco flourishes (“we were trying to find a look that is non-colonial,” says Mabena). If guests leave their curtains open, they can wake with the dawn and catch the first signs of life outside from east-facing floor-to-ceiling windows. The river is a wildlife focal point, meaning guests can spend all day lounging on balconies or swimming in the pool while checking out activity below. “Having hippos grunting underneath the carriage attracts people who want to be in the wild but don’t want to be immersed in the wild,” says Mabena. Nevertheless, many visitors strap on boots and head into the bush with a guide on a game drive. Staff including senior guide Thuli Mnisi were recruited as part of efforts to involve the local community in the enterprise. Mnisi had worked as a guide for other companies since 2014 before joining Kruger Shalati. “(It’s) totally different from other lodges,” she says. “When (guests) visit the train for the first time, it’s breath-taking, the view is unique.” Kruger National Park allows self-driving safari experiences, but Mnisi says there’s no substitute for having a guide. “We communicate with one another, we know where we can find the animals,” she says. “If you’re (on) a self-drive, you can just wander around Kruger National Park, and it’s a very big area. If you go with a guide, they know what they’re doing, they know where to find what and exactly at what time.” Gardeners have planted indigenous species on the hotel grounds and nurture a kitchen garden, with produce used in Kruger Shalati’s fine dining restaurant. Local delicacies served in the refined setting include crocodile, venison, and springbok carpaccio. “Mother nature is the true artist,” says chef Vusi Mbatha. “It’s one of those philosophies that we share: take simple ingredients and transform them into something amazing.” After development delays courtesy of Covid-19, the hotel opened in December 2020 and is welcoming guests for its fourth summer season. Double and twin rooms aboard the train start at 9,950 Rand ($530) per person, per night for international guests, with discounts for longer stays. One of the seven rooms in the adjacent Bridge House cost less. Rates include all meals, certain drinks, two game drives and airport transfers. If all this sounds like too much wildlife and not enough trains, Motsamayi Tourism Group also owns Kruger Station, just south of the bridge and home to the last train to operate in the park. Stranded after most of the tracks in the park were removed in the 1970s, the South African Railway Class 24 steam locomotive has lived many lives (including a funeral coach for a former prime minister) and now enjoys a happy retirement alongside a restaurant and bar. “The culture of steam trains and the culture of historical trains I think is beginning to re-emerge,” says Mabena. “We don’t have a moving steam train, but one day, I think we will.”",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/kruger-shalati-the-train-on-the-bridge-luxury-hotel-kruger-south-africa-spc/index.html,"south africa home luxurious nostalgic train journey offer anywhere world certain enthusiast train going nowhere country ’ star attraction kruger shalati train bridge hotel skukuza kruger national park one africa ’ largest game reserve part unesco world heritage site comprising set train carriage renovated twenty-four modern suite balcony pool overlooking sabie river marries luxury accommodation intimate view wildlife including sighting africa ’ “ big five ” — lion leopard rhino elephant buffalo jerry mabena ceo motsamayi tourism group owns hotel say venture harks back earliest day park steam train would pas kruger 1920s selati railway line train vital tourist accessing kruger would even park overnight bridge hotel sits today new railway line built edge kruger 1970s pushed selati line bridge retirement two thousand and sixteen idea formed restore bridge former glory “ idea u reenact experience form another ” mabena say “ opportunity buy mothballed old carriage transnet — rail logistics operator south africa — ’ say idea ” carriage ’ interior renovated modern finish albeit art deco flourish “ trying find look noncolonial ” say mabena guest leave curtain open wake dawn catch first sign life outside eastfacing floortoceiling window river wildlife focal point meaning guest spend day lounging balcony swimming pool checking activity “ hippo grunting underneath carriage attracts people want wild ’ want immersed wild ” say mabena nevertheless many visitor strap boot head bush guide game drive staff including senior guide thuli mnisi recruited part effort involve local community enterprise mnisi worked guide company since two thousand and fourteen joining kruger shalati “ ’ totally different lodge ” say “ guest visit train first time ’ breathtaking view unique ” kruger national park allows selfdriving safari experience mnisi say ’ substitute guide “ communicate one another know find animal ” say “ ’ selfdrive wander around kruger national park ’ big area go guide know ’ know find exactly time ” gardener planted indigenous specie hotel ground nurture kitchen garden produce used kruger shalati ’ fine dining restaurant local delicacy served refined setting include crocodile venison springbok carpaccio “ mother nature true artist ” say chef vusi mbatha “ ’ one philosophy share take simple ingredient transform something amazing ” development delay courtesy covid19 hotel opened december two thousand and twenty welcoming guest fourth summer season double twin room aboard train start nine thousand, nine hundred and fifty rand five hundred and thirty per person per night international guest discount longer stay one seven room adjacent bridge house cost le rate include meal certain drink two game drive airport transfer sound like much wildlife enough train motsamayi tourism group also owns kruger station south bridge home last train operate park stranded track park removed 1970s south african railway class twenty-four steam locomotive lived many life including funeral coach former prime minister enjoys happy retirement alongside restaurant bar “ culture steam train culture historical train think beginning reemerge ” say mabena “ ’ moving steam train one day think ”",2
32,Ukraine’s soldiers ‘in deep defense mode’ as uncertainty lingers over commander-in-chief,"In June 2021, as America reeled in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, commentator Jonathan Rauch described former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon’s media strategy thus: “This is not about persuasion; This is about disorientation.” In a sentence, Rauch encapsulated an approach that’s become increasingly popular among much of the right. Rather than follow a clear line of reasoning, zigzag back and forth between arguments. Rather than offer one explanation for any given event, offer several. And perhaps most effectively of all, co-opt the ideas and language of the left to cut through to an ever larger, ever more confused audience. It’s not about persuasion, it’s about disorientation. We’ve seen examples of this across many of the most debated news stories and political debates of the past few years. The hypocrisy of billionaire and former President Donald Trump raging against the elites, the crass inhumanity of anti-maskers invoking George Floyd’s final words during their protests and the weird, inside-out logic of purported feminists arguing against women’s reproductive rights, to name a few. This week, a new example came into view. The unsubstantiated, misleading misogyny of former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s tirade about the harm plastic surgery does to women. It went like this. Toward the end of a recent episode of “The Megyn Kelly Show,” a SiriusXM program that also streams on YouTube, Kelly pulled up what she said was a “relatively recent” photo of “The Boys” actress Erin Moriarty. She cooed over how “beautiful” Moriarty was — “so beautiful that she was becoming a very famous Hollywood actress.” Kelly then pulled up a second image of Moriarty, this time wearing very different makeup. She declared that the actress had “completely changed her face.” Kelly lamented what she described as Moriarty’s new “Kim Kardashian lips,” a nose “so skinny it looks like a pencil now” and “what appear to me to be cheek implants.” “I’m starting — not to pick on this Moriarty gal,” she said. But “more and more young women are doing this…. It’s not about an objection to plastic surgery. It’s about an obsession with turning yourself into this fake version of yourself.” The next several minutes were spent conferring with her guest, the conservative political commentator Michael Knowles, about the second photograph and its apparent implications. Kelly suggested that Moriarty’s apparent “obsession” was a sign of “mental illness.” Knowles agreed, adding that they denoted a social media-driven “hyper-reality” that drove women to alter their appearances until they look “grotesque.” The only element of Knowles’ analysis that Kelly disagreed with was his view that women almost never look better after plastic surgery. “I’ve seen a lot of women benefit from, in particular, nose jobs,” she mused, before reemphasizing her belief that Moriarty and women like her have a “mental disorder.” Finally, she confessed to having wondered initially whether the second photo was “an AI-generated face.” It was, of course, nonsense. But it was nonsense that caused Moriarty herself very real distress. Over the weekend, Moriarty posted a detailed response to her Instagram page. She said that since Kelly’s show had aired, she’d “BARELY been able to eat and sleep.” She pointed out that the alleged “before” photo, which Kelly claimed had been taken about a year ago, was in fact about a decade old. The comments made during the segment, Moriarty stressed, were “disgustingly false,” and “counterproductive to the degree of being ironically misogynistic.” A representative for Kelly did not respond to multiple outlets’ requests for comment. “Ironically misogynistic” is exactly right. Throughout her segment on Moriarty, Kelly latched onto what might, in other hands, under other circumstances, have been sympathetic and important themes. She flagged mental health, the pressures put on women by social media and the beauty industry and the struggle to remain authentic in an increasingly “fake,” AI-dominated world. In Kelly’s hands, however, those ideas were twisted. Mental illness wasn’t suggested in terms of sympathy or curiosity, but condemnation. The beauty industry wasn’t the target, nor, more importantly, the patriarchal, capitalist systems that fuel it. But the women who fail (in her opinion) to look “classy” were. And, as Moriarty pointed out, the entire basis for Kelly’s argument — that she’d drastically altered her appearance in a very short space of time — was utterly misconstrued. Unfortunately for Moriarty, the damage is done. Observers posted vicious comments about her appearance. Moriarty said she would be taking “an extensive if not permanent break” from social media and in her words, she experienced “one of the most challenging weeks” of her life. So much for Kelly’s concerns about her mental health. Moriarty’s peace of mind is not the only potential casualty, though. As history has proven, the more such sensitive themes and language are used so disingenuously, the harder it becomes for those who mean well to deploy them sincerely and effectively. As author and social activist Naomi Klein wrote in her book “Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World” when discussing how anti-vaxxers co-opted the phrase “bodily integrity:” “Abusing such terms is dangerous: it drains them of their intended meaning, their legibility, and power.” To apply the principle in this instance: the more people like Megyn Kelly use phrases like “mental illness” to underpin their prejudiced, callous thinking, the harder it becomes to have a sensible, empathetic discussion using that same language. As Rauch put it: It’s not about persuasion, it’s about disorientation.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/31/opinions/megyn-kelly-erin-moriarty-plastic-surgery-fake-feminism-thomas/index.html,june two thousand and twenty-one america reeled aftermath january six insurrection commentator jonathan rauch described former white house chief strategist steve bannon ’ medium strategy thus “ persuasion disorientation ” sentence rauch encapsulated approach ’ become increasingly popular among much right rather follow clear line reasoning zigzag back forth argument rather offer one explanation given event offer several perhaps effectively coopt idea language left cut ever larger ever confused audience ’ persuasion ’ disorientation ’ seen example across many debated news story political debate past year hypocrisy billionaire former president donald trump raging elite crass inhumanity antimaskers invoking george floyd ’ final word protest weird insideout logic purported feminist arguing woman ’ reproductive right name week new example came view unsubstantiated misleading misogyny former fox news anchor megyn kelly ’ tirade harm plastic surgery woman went like toward end recent episode “ megyn kelly show ” siriusxm program also stream youtube kelly pulled said “ relatively recent ” photo “ boy ” actress erin moriarty cooed “ beautiful ” moriarty — “ beautiful becoming famous hollywood actress ” kelly pulled second image moriarty time wearing different makeup declared actress “ completely changed face ” kelly lamented described moriarty ’ new “ kim kardashian lip ” nose “ skinny look like pencil ” “ appear cheek implant ” “ ’ starting — pick moriarty gal ” said “ young woman this… ’ objection plastic surgery ’ obsession turning fake version ” next several minute spent conferring guest conservative political commentator michael knowles second photograph apparent implication kelly suggested moriarty ’ apparent “ obsession ” sign “ mental illness ” knowles agreed adding denoted social mediadriven “ hyperreality ” drove woman alter appearance look “ grotesque ” element knowles ’ analysis kelly disagreed view woman almost never look better plastic surgery “ ’ seen lot woman benefit particular nose job ” mused reemphasizing belief moriarty woman like “ mental disorder ” finally confessed wondered initially whether second photo “ aigenerated face ” course nonsense nonsense caused moriarty real distress weekend moriarty posted detailed response instagram page said since kelly ’ show aired ’ “ barely able eat sleep ” pointed alleged “ ” photo kelly claimed taken year ago fact decade old comment made segment moriarty stressed “ disgustingly false ” “ counterproductive degree ironically misogynistic ” representative kelly respond multiple outlet ’ request comment “ ironically misogynistic ” exactly right throughout segment moriarty kelly latched onto might hand circumstance sympathetic important theme flagged mental health pressure put woman social medium beauty industry struggle remain authentic increasingly “ fake ” aidominated world kelly ’ hand however idea twisted mental illness ’ suggested term sympathy curiosity condemnation beauty industry ’ target importantly patriarchal capitalist system fuel woman fail opinion look “ classy ” moriarty pointed entire basis kelly ’ argument — ’ drastically altered appearance short space time — utterly misconstrued unfortunately moriarty damage done observer posted vicious comment appearance moriarty said would taking “ extensive permanent break ” social medium word experienced “ one challenging week ” life much kelly ’ concern mental health moriarty ’ peace mind potential casualty though history proven sensitive theme language used disingenuously harder becomes mean well deploy sincerely effectively author social activist naomi klein wrote book “ doppelganger trip mirror world ” discussing antivaxxers coopted phrase “ bodily integrity ” “ abusing term dangerous drain intended meaning legibility power ” apply principle instance people like megyn kelly use phrase like “ mental illness ” underpin prejudiced callous thinking harder becomes sensible empathetic discussion using language rauch put ’ persuasion ’ disorientation,8
33,At least 2 dead after woman steals police car and crashes into truck,"The Vision Pro, Apple’s first new product in seven years, officially launched in stores on Friday in the US. The mixed reality headset went on sale at Apple Stores across the country as some eager shoppers were among the first to get their hands on what promises to be one of the most innovative tech products in years. On Friday morning at Apple’s New York City Flagship Store, CEO Tim Cook welcomed waiting customers into the store — shaking hands and taking selfies as employees cheered. Around 200 people had lined up ahead of the 8 a.m. launch, including customers from around the world. People are also able to receive private one-on-one demos on a first come, first served basis at retail stores. CEO Tim Cook has long talked up the potential for augmented reality to help people communicate and collaborate. Now he will have to prove that a device that blends both virtual reality and augmented reality, a technology that overlays virtual images on live video of the real world, is indeed the future of computing. Ahead of the release, Cook called it “the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created.” But it won’t be an easy sell: It’s a $3,499 clunky computer you wear on your face. The headset will have 256 GB of storage, and prescription lens inserts for the device will be available starting at $149. Reading lens inserts start at $99. Once you factor in additional accessories, like a $200 travel case and $50 battery pack holder and more, it can cost up to $4,600, The New York Times reported. The headset enters just as the extended reality (XR) market — a category that includes augmented, virtual and mixed reality — has plateaued with little mainstream consumer adoption. The Vision Pro has limited apps out of the gate and will be tethered to a battery pack the size of an iPhone, offering about 2.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. The experience, however, is unmatched when it comes to watching immersive videos and interacting with the world around you. It’s rare to find a new technology that feels groundbreaking, but in the two demos CNN experienced ahead of the launch, it’s easy to see the future — or at least an early and very pricey prototype of it. The headset itself looks like a pair of designer ski goggles. It features a soft adjustable strap on the top, a “digital crown” on the back — a bigger version than what you’d find on an Apple Watch — and another digital crown on the top that serves as a kind of home button. Although it’s still a computer around the eyes, it’s surprisingly light and comfortable to wear. The setup process is easy: First, the headset tracks the eyes, scan hands and maps the room. Users will then see an iOS-like interface placed in front of their environment. By using eye movements and touching the thumb and pointer finger together, it activates a “select” button, allowing people to seamlessly go in and out of apps, such as Messages, FaceTime, Safari and Photos. The interface also responds to voice to activate Siri. Photos can be viewed at life size or as if you’re watching them on a giant movie screen. Panoramics, meanwhile, place you directly within the scene. Vision Pro also offers a spatial photo option, which lets users view images and videos in 3D for an even more life-like experience. Use cases for the Vision Pro vary from cooking and meditating to working. Users can sync up their Mac computer to turn the screen into an enormous display and connect a physical keyboard. To maximize productivity, it’s possible to have several windows open at once: Email can be kept on one side, a Safari browser opened perhaps in the middle and a FaceTime call on the right. If a user is wearing Vision Pro while on FaceTime, they appear as a Persona, or an avatar-like digital representation of their face. The real magic of the Vision Pro, however, is in the immersive videos. During a recent demo, we watched “Star Wars” clips on Disney+ while sitting inside a virtual representation of Luke Skywalker’s landspeeder vehicle, a viewing experience that will delight any movie fan. Watching an underwater scene from “Avatar 2” in 3D, meanwhile, was also surreal, seemingly placing users right in the ocean. Apple has taken steps to reduce the motion sickness problem that has plagued other headsets, thanks to a custom chip that cuts down on the latency issue found in similar products. Vision Pro includes surround sound, with audio pods that sit outside the ears to deliver rich immersive audio. To help users navigate their new headset, Apple has included a nearly 10-minute guided tour on its website. Almost every new Apple product, from the iPhone to the Apple Watch, promises to use screens of varying sizes to change how we live, work and interact with the world. The Vision Pro has the potential to do all of that in an even more striking way. But out of the gate, the Vision Pro will likely remain a niche product for die-hard Apple enthusiasts and developers, largely due to the price tag. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said during the first pre-order weekend last month, the company sold an estimated 160,000 to 180,000 Vision Pro headsets. Shipping times remained largely unchanged after the first 48 hours, indicating demand could wane after core fans have placed orders. Shipping windows typically widen after new iPhone models sell out. Morgan Stanley analysts project the company will ship up to 400,000 Vision Pro units this year.

34,"Taylor Swift makes Grammys history with fourth album of the year win, after announcing surprise new album","Thousands of soccer fans in Hong Kong were left disappointed when Argentine superstar Lionel Messi failed to take to the field in a friendly match for Inter Miami on Sunday. What started with overwhelming cheers and rapture ended in boos and calls for refunds in the sold-out, 40,000-seat Hong Kong Stadium. Inter Miami — out to prove a point having gone winless during a worldwide pre-season tour — comfortably defeated a Hong Kong XI 4-1 in an event branded as Tatler XFEST Hong Kong. But even in the lead-up to and during the game, there was the sense that the scoreline did not matter to fans; more important was witnessing Messi, a World Cup champion and eight-time Ballon d’Or winner, grace the field. Even Hong Kong’s government has shared its dismay at the 36-year-old not featuring in the match. “Messi was not able to play in the friendly game today and the government and fans are equally disappointed at the arrangements by the event organiser,” it said in a statement on Sunday. “The event organiser owes fans an explanation.” New signing Luis Suárez also did not feature despite attending the pre-match press conference, while other marquee players Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets were only substituted on in the second half. The additional trophy presentation, fireworks and speech by club co-owner David Beckham were engulfed in whistles and jeers in a rather awkward end to the trip. The boos continued when the big-screen cameras panned to Messi. The shift in mood had occurred towards the final 20 minutes of the game — the clamors of “We want Messi” turned into “Where is Messi?”, while boos rang out each time a player other than Messi was substituted onto the pitch. Shouts of “refund, refund, refund” in both English and Cantonese could also be heard in injury time. According to Reuters, tickets went on sale in December and cost between 880 and 4,880 Hong Kong dollars (about $113 and $624). CNN has contacted event organizer Tatler for comment. In a statement on Sunday, Tatler XFEST expressed “extreme disappointment” that Messi and Suárez did not play in Hong Kong and said that it “did not have any information about the non-participation” of the players prior to kick-off. Miami coach Gerardo “Tata” Martino explained that the decision not to field Messi was made on very late notice and under the recommendation of the club’s medical staff. “We understand the reception from the fans towards the absence of Leo and Luis,” Martino said apologetically, also thanking Hong Kong for the “care” they had received throughout the weekend. “This was a decision made together with our medical team. We checked their physical wellbeing and they risked sustaining an injury if they went onto the pitch so they couldn’t play. “We understand the disappointment from the fans and we ask for their forgiveness. We wish we could have played them for even a short while, but the risk was too big.” Martino was pressed on the type of injury Messi had sustained as there were already reports that the star player was carrying a hamstring problem since Miami’s previous friendly against Al-Nassr in Saudi Arabia. “Leo has an inflammation of the adductor as we saw from the images of his muscles. We were expecting an improvement, but the situation has been there for many days,” Martino said, adding that Suarez sustained a knee injury during the Saudi Arabia trip. “We were checking it constantly with the medical team, and we also had to consider our obligations with the upcoming MLS [Major League Soccer]. So we came to the conclusion not to play Messi in the match. “In reality, we have been assessing Leo’s condition day-by-day. Yesterday [Saturday] he was in the final training [session], and we assessed it in the hotel until this morning. The decision was not made until the afternoon.” Hong Kong XI captain Yapp Hung-fai, who played in the first-half of Sunday’s match, said he was “of course quite disappointed” not to have played against Messi, but was still appreciative of the experience. “On a personal note, obviously quite disappointed because he doesn’t go to Hong Kong much,” said Yapp, who was captaining a team of players from across the first division. “But we have to think about our own performance and not focus too much on the opponents, who were still of a high level. To play in a full stadium is already satisfying.” The overall sentiment was shared by local Messi superfan Christer Leung, who spearheads the city’s Argentina national team supporters’ club. “I think everyone’s disappointed,” Leung, who named his son Lionel after the forward, told CNN. “It was unexpected, I thought he would feature for at least five minutes. Otherwise we wouldn’t have paid the ticket prices to get in here. You heard the mood, which was I think justified but uncalled for at the same time. “This whole Messi in Hong Kong thing has been building up for quite some time. Everyone was so excited and there was so much drama with the tickets. “The training session [on Saturday] was also quite disappointing because he didn’t really do much and it was cut short. Everyone expected today would be a little bit more, so everyone is going to be disappointed. “But, as his supporter for a long time, I fully respect the decision not to play him if he is really suffering, because he’s 36. “I blame Inter Miami scheduling so many friendlies in so many different places. They should have invited everyone to come to America. I guess they wanted to grow the brand internationally, which makes sense.” “Messi mania” had captured the city with the team’s arrival on Friday as fans swarmed the hotel that Miami were staying at. Meanwhile, the stadium had already reached full capacity during the team’s open training session the evening before. Ardent support for Messi also gripped mainland China last summer after the Argentina national team played a friendly match against Australia in Beijing. It was the superstar’s seventh time in China, and his eighth could come in March as Argentina confirmed two friendly matches against Nigeria and Ivory Coast in Hangzhou and Beijing.

35,Best red carpet looks at the Grammys,"A video obtained by CNN shows two young ultra-Orthodox men spitting at, swearing at and insulting a Christian priest near the Zion Gate in Jerusalem’s Old City on Saturday evening. Natalie Amiri, a correspondent for German TV network ARD, was interviewing Father Nikodemus Schnabel when the incident occurred, and captured most of it on video, which she shared on Instagram to her 114,000 followers. She later sent the videos to CNN. She described two young men crossing their path as they walked through the Old City. One of them, she said, approached them and spat at Schnabel. The assault was not captured on camera, but the sound of spitting is clearly audible. The priest and journalist continued to walk through the Old City, and were again approached by the same two men as they walked through the Armenian Quarter. They approached Schnabel, proceeded to spit at him again, verbally insult him, and one of them kicked him, a video shows. Another video filmed by Amiri after the initial spitting incident shows Father Schnabel attempting to take a photo of the young men’s faces to show police. “You have no right to touch me and spit on me,” he tells one of the men in English as the other attempts to block Amiri’s camera with his hand. “The police are always asking. I need a picture of his face.” One of the men walks up to Schnabel, yelling profanities. An older man intervenes and convinces him in Hebrew to back off, but the suspect tells the man to “watch out.” “I did that to the priest because they are Christians, brother, and this is what I do to them,” one of them says to others watching the incident. An armed Israeli man then intervenes and physically guides the men away from Schnabel, as one yells “f***ing Jesus” in English at Schnabel. The men were later arrested by Israeli Police and are currently being held under house arrest as the incident is investigated. “Last night, the police received a report regarding youths who traversed the Zion Gate area in the Old City of Jerusalem. These individuals engaged in verbal insults and spat towards a religious man passing by before hastily fleeing the scene,” the police statement said Sunday. The suspects, one of whom is 17 years old, were brought in for questioning, according to police, and they were both subsequently placed under house arrest. Christians in the Old City are regularly the target of spitting and verbal abuse by Orthodox Jews. Five people were arrested in October, accused of spitting at people or churches. The Latin Patriarchy of Jerusalem said Sunday on X that it “condemns the unprovoked and shameful assault” on Schnabel.

36,See the full list of winners,"Punxatawney Phil, the central character of the annual rite of winter known as Groundhog’s Day, isn’t great at his job. His predictions are wrong more often than they are right. On Friday, the divining marmot did not see his shadow, indicating an early spring. Though, technically speaking, winter will end on the spring equinox, which falls on the evening of March 19. But the groundhog is just one of numerous animals that, according to folklore, possess an uncanny ability to forecast the weather, including cows that are said to lie down before early rain and woolly bear caterpillars that are supposedly decorated with less color before a frigid winter. Most of these associations are unmoored from modern science — but there is an occasional hint of documented fact among the myths. Phenology is the study of how seasonal events in the lives of plants and animals shift according to the weather and climate, such as how fish or migratory birds respond to the temperature of water and air. (The field of study can be practiced as a hard science, for the record, and is entirely distinct from the pseudoscientific “phrenology.”) The USA National Phenology Network tracks when ecological markers of spring arrive across the United States — and the season is already in bloom in certain locations on the east and west coasts. Theresa Crimmins, the director of the USA National Phenology Network, said that while Punxatawney Phil is not a reliable predictor of spring’s arrival, phenology does offer scientific backing for other seemingly superstitious axioms about the natural world. “People have been observing (environmental conditions) for many millennia, for basically as long as humans have been around,” Crimmins said. “So (a lot of these adages) actually work because they are, in a sense, capturing those relationships between the environmental conditions and plant response.” But while folklore often supposes animal behavior portends future weather events, in reality, flora and fauna react to weather and climate. The roots of Groundhog Day lie in traditions that were likely imported to the United States from Germany, where the winter-forecasting animal was a badger rather than a groundhog. However, numerous tried-and-true proverbs about the natural world come from Native American populations. “One example is planting corn when oak leaves are the size of a squirrel’s ear,” notes an article on phenology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “You know that planting corn has nothing to do with oak leaves or squirrels. However, Native Americans made the observation centuries ago that the soil was warm enough to prevent seeds from rotting, yet it was still early enough to reap a suitable harvest if corn was planted at this time.” Crimmins points out that there are plenty of other predictors for coming ecological events spelled out in the leaves, berries and flowers of plants. For example, the shadblow serviceberry is a small tree that is native to parts of eastern North America, and it’s believed that its name came from the fact that it bears flowers at the same time of year that shad fish begin their river migration. The Lenape and other Native American populations made note of the phenomenon long ago and prepared to fish when the plant began to bloom. The Old Farmer’s Almanac  has aggregated a couple dozen adages about insects, animals and their ability to predict weather patterns. Some of the claims are dubious. Dogs eating grass, for example, is likely a far less accurate predictor of rain than a meteorologist’s weather report. But there is research out there that suggests some animals may possess an innate sense that helps them detect when a disaster is on the way. Golden-winged warblers, for example, evacuated an area of Tennessee more than 24 hours before a devastating string of tornadoes hit the area, according to a December 2014 study published in the journal Current Biology. The study authors predicted the migrant birds listened to infrasound — sound at frequencies too low for humans to hear — associated with the storms and heeded it as a warning sign. Researchers in Germany also looked into whether various species of animals could detect an oncoming earthquake. The scientists found that, collectively, animals including cows, sheep and dogs exhibited more activity before an earthquake up to 20 hours in advance, according to a report from Germany’s Max Planck Society, a nonprofit association of research institutes. There is also truth to the notion that crickets can act as nature’s thermometer. The insects are ectotherms, meaning their body temperature changes with that of their surrounding environment — and they routinely chirp faster in warmer weather. According to Dolbear’s Law, a formula describing this association between crickets and weather, “you can count the number of chirps per 15 seconds, add 40, and that will give you the temperature in Fahrenheit,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration notes. Frogs also deliver unique calls when it’s about to rain. “Many twentieth-century herpetologists have confirmed and clarified the traditional observation that various species of frogs sometimes utter a distinctive vocalization, a ‘rain call,’ a short time before wet weather,” said Dr. Gordon Miller, a professor emeritus of environmental studies at Seattle University, via email. The calls “are perhaps triggered by a rise in humidity prior to precipitation,” Miller said. Other tropes about animals’ ability to predict seasonal conditions, however, are wrong. The woolly bear — a species of caterpillar, also called the woolly worm — famously is thought to forecast the severity of the impending winter with its colored bands. More black coloring on the insect supposedly indicates harsher conditions on the way. But in reality, the “caterpillar’s coloring is based on how long (the) caterpillar has been feeding, its age, and species,” according to the National Weather Service. “The better the growing season is the bigger it will grow. This results in narrower red-orange bands in its middle. Thus, the width of the banding is an indicator of the current or past season’s growth rather than an indicator of the severity of the upcoming winter.” Unusual animal behavior can also be a reaction to a changing climate, Crimmins emphasized. And often not in good ways. The climate crisis and human development are causing all sorts of ecological problems, Crimmins noted. Bears, for example, are entering hibernation later and arising earlier because of the warmer weather. That can lead to more human-bear interactions  as bears search for food, and there is concern about how shorter hibernation periods are affecting bear pregnancies. Miller added that, while frogs may be able to foretell incoming rainfall, “with so many amphibian species continuing to decline due to various environmental and climatic factors, perhaps their most clarion call to us today, as Rachel Carson noted of birds in 1962, is their diminishing chorus and growing silence.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/world/can-groundhogs-predict-weather-scn/index.html,"punxatawney phil central character annual rite winter known groundhog ’ day ’ great job prediction

37,How long your dog lives might come down to a key characteristic,"On Wednesday, the chief executives of Meta, TikTok, X, Snap and Discord testified before the Senate about what they’re doing to protect kids from harm online. While Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and TikTok’s Shou Chew appeared voluntarily, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois chastised Snap’s Evan Spiegel, X’s Linda Yaccarino and Discord’s Jason Citron for having to be subpoenaed and noted that federal marshals had to be sent to Citron’s offices to serve his subpoena. Durbin accused social networks of harming kids’ mental health, saying that they not only “have contributed to this crisis, they are responsible for many of the dangers our children face online.” Senators also expressed concern about how children are being exploited online. “Sextortionists,” for example, are convincing kids to share racy images — sometimes by pretending to form a romantic relationship — and then blackmailing them by threatening to make the images public if they don’t provide more explicit content or money (or, sometimes, both). This can destroy people’s lives and puts them at risk of depression and suicide. “You have blood on your hands,” South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told the executives. In the leadup to the testimony, tech companies announced new initiatives to protect kids. Apps like Instagram and TikTok are prompting kids to take breaks or limit their screentime and have changed their algorithms to show kids less toxic content, like posts about eating disorders. Meta says it’s hiding this kind of inappropriate content from kids and has changed teens’ default privacy settings to help prevent people they don’t know from messaging them. Snapchat is giving parents more oversight options, like information about their kids’ safety settings. Chew testified that, on TikTok, accounts for children under age 16 are set to private and not recommended to people they don’t know, and Yaccarino said children between the ages of 13 and 17 can’t accept messages from people they don’t approve on X. Spiegel noted there aren’t public likes or comments on Snapchat. These are all critical features. Zuckerberg also stood up and apologized to families of children harmed by social media who attended the hearing, saying, “I’m sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should go through the things that your families have suffered and this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer.” But it’s not enough. Lawmakers and tech companies need to do much more to protect our kids. The Stop CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) Act of 2023 would make it possible to hold tech companies civilly liable for hosting child sexual abuse material. This would be an important way of incentivizing tech companies to do more to protect kids from sextortion and other forms of online exploitation. The SHIELD Act would criminalize sharing or threatening to share intimate images without the person’s consent (which is popularly known as “revenge porn”). This is also an essential way of protecting kids and adults. Tech companies also have a lot more work to do. While they may claim they’re showing kids less harmful posts, it’s still unclear how they’re identifying what’s harmful. Tech companies should work with experts in adolescent health to develop and share standards for content that can be shown to kids so that potentially harmful posts about things like body image and mental health don’t appear on their feeds at all, and so content creators know what the rules are and can try to follow them. Then, they need to hire a lot more human moderators to determine whether content meets those standards before showing it to children. We can’t trust artificial intelligence tools to do this vetting — one internal document showed that automated systems removed less than 1% of content that violated the company’s rules about violence and incitement, for example. (Zuckerberg said during the hearing that “99% or so” of the content Meta removes is automatically identified using AI.) But figuring out ways for humans to vet content is not as difficult as it may sound — Snapchat, for example, doesn’t promote videos from its creator program to more than 25 people until they’re reviewed by human moderators. We also need to know what big trends our kids are being exposed to online. Currently, none of these platforms give us good metrics about what’s trending on their platforms. TikTok, for example, recently disabled the search function on a tool that allows people to search popular hashtags on the app, on the heels of a report that found topics censored by the Chinese government were less prevalent on TikTok than on Instagram. All social apps should provide tools that show what’s trending, and also break down what’s trending among users under age 18 so parents know what to talk to their kids about. As I write in my forthcoming book, “Over the Influence: Why Social Media is Toxic for Women and Girls – And How We Can Take It Back,” when kids search for content related to mental health, tech companies should show them boxes with links to organizations that can help them. It’s astounding to think that, instead, kids searching for this content could be served videos that make their problems worse. I also argue in my book that these apps should identify when photos have been filtered or otherwise manipulated, so kids are constantly reminded that the images they are seeing of other peoples’ bodies often aren’t real. This could help them develop realistic body images. Finally, these tech companies should be doing a better job of using their platforms to give children information that helps and empowers them — like lessons on how to use social media in healthy ways. For example, on the heels of the nude deepfakes of Taylor Swift that have been circulating online in recent days, social apps should be showing kids content about how to spot fake images and why they should never create or engage with them. As I write in my book, when nude images of a woman circulate online, it puts her at greater risk of sexual assault, unemployment, difficulty dating, depression and even suicide. Tech executives promised to protect kids in their testimony to senators. But they didn’t promise to do what’s actually needed to safeguard kids’ physical and mental well-being.

39,"French superstar Mbappé decides to join Real Madrid after PSG contract expires, reports say","Think of road trips and you might automatically imagine motoring along US highways, or roaming country to country through the mountains and vales of Europe. But it’s also possible in Saudi Arabia and – although some people might believe this would be a dusty, boring experience – it offers a surprisingly varied driving experience, along blacktop and gravel, through stunning deserts, bustling towns and lush oases. While the kingdom has spent many decades largely off-limits to tourism, recent changes made to make it more accessible mean that the bureaucracy around visitors driving in Saudi Arabia has simplified and the roads are wide open. Both men and women can drive solo or accompanied, whether they are locals or visitors. One popular road trip for expats and locals alike is the highway through the country’s Eastern Province, which stretches along the Gulf coast and borders Kuwait in the north and Qatar, Bahrain (via an oversea causeway), Oman and the United Arab Emirates in the south. It’s not prime tourism territory – the Red Sea coast is where major resort developments are underway and is better known as a leisure destination – but that can make the Eastern Province seem even more exciting. And there’s no shortage of sights and experiences to explore. Here’s what you need to know about taking a road trip in this part of Saudi Arabia: Getting to the Eastern Province coastline is relatively easy with direct flights from other Mideast destinations to international airports near the coastal city of Dammam and Al Ahsa, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland. There are also connections from Riyadh. Cars can be hired at both airports, with most of the international rental companies represented. Typically, you will be permitted to drive the rental car abroad if desired, allowing some Gulf-coast country-hopping. But you will need to advise your hire company beforehand, and obtain a permission letter from them to show at the border, together with a valid visa. Driving in Saudi can be a mixed bag, from super-modern highways to gravel tracks, and you’ll often find your path obscured by sand dunes encroaching on the roads, plus there are long distances between cities. That means it’s advisable to hire a larger 4WD vehicle that will get you out of potential off-road trouble as well as offering comfort and better views from a slightly higher perch. The country’s road network is relatively modern, and connects all the major dots on the map. A main road runs all along the eastern coastline, with a new stretch that opened just this year between Salwa, by the Qatar border, and the Saudi seaport of Al Uqair, joining up previous and somewhat patchy road segments. Now it’s possible to stay on one road, Highway 5, all the way from the UAE to Kuwait, with plenty of worthwhile stops along the way. The road is a dual carriageway, crossing a sandy and flat desert, with the sea on the right, if you are driving north. The maximum speed on this road is 120 kmh (75 mph), with radar controls along the way. While the road – and all the main roads in Saudi – are reasonably well maintained, there is a constant threat of stretches being submerged under sand as desert dunes edge onto the Tarmac. Some stretches lack camel fences, so drivers must always be aware of “ships of the desert” strolling into the road. There are regular service stations but drivers should always keep an eye on the tank, as they can sometimes be quite far apart. Unless you have sufficient experience or are accompanied by someone who knows the ins and outs of off-roading, it’s best to stay on the main road. Driving in sand takes a lot of know-how – deflating the tires to the right pressure, steering and handling manual gears. Getting stuck in the sand, miles from anywhere, is a real and dangerous possibility. But if you do have the opportunity to try it with an experienced driver, go for it. It’s an exhilarating experience, and in the Eastern Province there are plenty of fine sand dunes around due to its proximity to Rub al-Khali, or the Empty Quarter, the world’s largest sand desert. Saudi Arabia’s rich history dates all the way back to pre-historic times. Long a waypoint on important trade routes and for centuries crisscrossed by Bedouin tribes, the entire country is dotted with ancient historic sites that have only in recent years become accessible to international visitors. And the Eastern Province is no exception. A drive along the coastal road will encounter several fortresses. Uquair Castle, which sits roughly halfway between Salwa and Al Khobar, near Bahrain, is backdropped by the beautiful turquoise waters of the Gulf. The history of the castle, which is currently closed due to renovation, is a little vague. There are no records as to who built it, but it’s thought to be some 300 years old. Along the same road, just north of Dammam, the imposing Tarout Castle sits on Tarout Island, accessed via causeway. With inscriptions found dating to the Mesopotamian era, the base of the castle is thought to be roughly 7,000 years old. The castle itself has been rebuilt numerous times over the centuries resulting in a mélange of historical influences. On the edge of the island, there are mangrove swamps which in winter play host to countless flamingos that add a splash of pink to the turquoise waters. Dammam itself is a bustling city, an industrial center, and a mix of old and new. There is the popular Love Market, a large night market selling food, souvenirs, clothes, kitchenware and more. For fans of modern architecture, the King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture in the suburb of Dhahran, designed by Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta, is a worthwhile stop, while beach and water sport enthusiasts will find plenty of resorts along the stretch of coast south of Al Khobar. Roughly an hour inland, toward Al Ahsa, lies Al Hofuf, a city that sits within what is described by UNESCO as the world’s largest oasis. Roughly 3 million palm trees cover the city and smaller surrounding villages. Al Hofuf’s old city center is a great base for exploring the oasis and nearby historic sights. Must-sees include the Ibrahim Palace, dating back to Ottoman times, and now a museum, and the Qaisariah Souq, which is particularly atmospheric on a Friday night when food stands and numerous musical performances draw the crowds. Walking around the alleyways of old Hofuf is like a step back in time, discovering old buildings adorned with modern street art, from King Khaleed Street to Ibrahim Palace. One of the most astounding sights is the Al Qarah Caves. Not caves in the traditional sense, these are actually an entrance into Al Qarah Mountain, a lone lump of rock rising above the oasis that over time has been eroded by rain and wind to form passages, caves, columns, and secluded canyons, with many places open to the sky. Made safe and beautifully lit, these caves offer a fascinating way to spend an hour or so. Visitors can climb to the top of the mountain from the other side of the rocks to appreciate the true expanse of the oasis and the numerous farms that make the region one of the world’s largest date producers. Eastern Province may not be number one on the list of things to see and do in Saudi Arabia, but it would be a shame to overlook it, as it offers great sights between several countries, and a fine and relatively easy introduction into road-tripping in Saudi Arabia.

40,"As Facebook turns 20, I have something to confess","If Punxsutawney Phil saw no shadow, suggesting an early spring, will Americans look at these new bonkers jobs numbers and begin to warm up to “Bidenomics?” Americans have for years expressed a general discomfort with the state of the economy, which has helped drag down President Joe Biden’s objectively pathetic approval rating. Despite gloomy perceptions of the economy, people have not stopped spending money, which has buoyed many of the economic indicators that please policymakers. Evidence of a strong economy has so far been lost on a general public that still feels the pinch of inflation and worries about the uncertainty of life in 2024. Data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged US job growth at 353,000 jobs in January, a stunning figure that doubled economists’ projections. The unemployment rate held at 3.7% and has now been under 4% for two full years. Employment data is but one indicator. There are others to choose from. The S&P 500, the stock index that tracks the largest publicly traded companies, has been on a record-setting tear, strengthening the balances of many people’s 401(k)s. The old political adage is that presidents get too much blame for bad economies and not enough credit for strong economies. The coming general election, shaping up to be a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, offers voters alternate realities to choose from. Biden and his surrogates are bragging about the economy and trying to convince voters that “Bidenomics,” a term the administration’s embraced, is working. Trump, meanwhile has said the economy would tumble and hopes it will happen on Biden’s watch rather than his own. He said the stock market is booming because of the prospect of his victory. And he’s promoting conspiracy theories about the Federal Reserve considering rate cuts to favor Biden. Instead, as inflation has cooled, the Fed has held rates steady, as it did this week, and transmitted that people should not expect rate cuts in March either. Everyone from investors to progressive senators are hoping for rate cuts to give people cheaper access to borrowed money and, among other things, unlock the real estate market. But Fed officials clearly want to be more certain that inflation is more under control. Their target for inflation is 2%, and recent reports suggest prices have steadied. Rather than suffer the recession that was widely predicted coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, the economy had a shockingly strong year in 2023 and is expected to grow at an even stronger 4.2% rate in the first quarter. But that doesn’t mean things are getting cheaper. Americans are still feeling the pinch at the grocery store and everywhere else they spend money. A new CNN poll shows Biden still has a lot of convincing to do: Perception of the economy remains deep under water. But the mood is heading in a positive direction – which should come as a relief to Biden, because the economy is one of his weakest issues, according to favorability polls. However, if hiring remains strong and inflation keeps falling, it may become easier for Biden to convince voters he’s doing a good job strengthening the economy. CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy notes that about half the country, 48%, thinks the economy remains in a downturn. Only 35% of Americans say that things in the country today are going well, which is actually an improvement from the 28% who felt positively about the state of affairs last fall. She adds that while just 26% of Americans say they feel the economy is starting to recover from the problems it faced in the past few years, that’s also up from 20% last summer and 17% in December 2022. The Fed’s work to control inflation was always billed as tough medicine, and there’s growing frustration with it. Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic senators told policymakers in a letter Sunday that they also have a duty to acknowledge that “astronomical” mortgage rates are fueling a housing affordability crisis. “We urge you to consider the effects of your interest rate decisions on the housing market and to reverse the troubling rate hikes that have put affordable housing out of reach for too many,” Warren and fellow Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper, Jacky Rosen and Sheldon Whitehouse wrote. Their letter is proof that the fact of a strong economy is felt, if at all, in different ways. Anyone hoping to buy or sell a house is not likely to say this is a great economy. Anyone in a sector, like tech, which has suffered massive layoffs, is not likely to say this is a great economy. And anyone who still feels like eggs are more expensive than they used to be may wonder how this can be a great economy.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/politics/economy-jobs-biden-what-matters/index.html,punxsutawney phil saw shadow suggesting early spring american look new bonkers job number begin warm “ bidenomics ” american year expressed general discomfort state economy helped drag president joe biden ’ objectively pathetic approval rating despite gloomy perception economy people stopped spending money buoyed many economic indicator please policymakers evidence strong economy far lost general public still feel pinch inflation worry uncertainty life two thousand and twenty-four data released friday bureau labor statistic pegged u job growth three hundred and fifty-three thousand job january stunning figure doubled economist ’ projection unemployment rate held thirty-seven four two full year employment data one indicator others choose sp five hundred stock index track largest publicly traded company recordsetting tear strengthening balance many people ’ 401ks old political adage president get much blame bad economy enough credit strong economy coming general election shaping rematch biden former president donald trump offer voter alternate reality choose biden surrogate bragging economy trying convince voter “ bidenomics ” term administration ’ embraced working trump meanwhile said economy would tumble hope happen biden ’ watch rather said stock market booming prospect victory ’ promoting conspiracy theory federal reserve considering rate cut favor biden instead inflation cooled fed held rate steady week transmitted people expect rate cut march either everyone investor progressive senator hoping rate cut give people cheaper access borrowed money among thing unlock real estate market fed official clearly want certain inflation control target inflation two recent report suggest price steadied rather suffer recession widely predicted coming covid19 pandemic economy shockingly strong year two thousand and twenty-three expected grow even stronger forty-two rate first quarter ’ mean thing getting cheaper american still feeling pinch grocery store everywhere else spend money new cnn poll show biden still lot convincing perception economy remains deep water mood heading positive direction – come relief biden economy one weakest issue according favorability poll however hiring remains strong inflation keep falling may become easier biden convince voter ’ good job strengthening economy cnn ’ polling editor ariel edwardslevy note half country forty-eight think economy remains downturn thirty-five american say thing country today going well actually improvement twenty-eight felt positively state affair last fall add twenty-six american say feel economy starting recover problem faced past year ’ also twenty last summer seventeen december two thousand and twenty-two fed ’ work control inflation always billed tough medicine ’ growing frustration sen elizabeth warren democratic senator told policymakers letter sunday also duty acknowledge “ astronomical ” mortgage rate fueling housing affordability crisis “ urge consider effect interest rate decision housing market reverse troubling rate hike put affordable housing reach many ” warren fellow democratic sen john hickenlooper jacky rosen sheldon whitehouse wrote letter proof fact strong economy felt different way anyone hoping buy sell house likely say great economy anyone sector like tech suffered massive layoff likely say great economy anyone still feel like egg expensive used may wonder great economy,9
41,Wellness influencers fueled pandemic misinformation. Now they’re targeting another crisis,"Edwards-Lowell Furs didn’t expect 2023 to be a good year. In anticipation of the ban on the sale of new furs that went into effect in its home state of California in January 2023, the company had transitioned its business from selling furs to storing them. Plus, Edwards-Lowell Furs’ said, dwindling sales — declines of around 50 percent year-on-year — had forced it to sell its building in Beverly Hills. But then owner Paul Matsumoto connected with Natalie Bloomingdale, founder and CEO of vintage e-tailer The Sil, and the two teamed up to host an online auction of pre-owned coats from Edwards-Lowell Furs’ on The Sil’s Instagram. “We sold the first batch of furs in a matter of minutes,” said Bloomingdale. The two now host sales three times a month, and Matsumoto said it’s breathed new life into the business. This year may bring even more demand due to the explosion of the “mob wives” aesthetic on TikTok. Characterized by animal prints, heavy gold jewelry, glossy leather trousers, perfectly coiffed hair and a massive fur coat, the trend has already racked up over 160 million views on the platform. Its emergence has been fueled by several factors — the 25th anniversary of HBO’s mafia-centric hit “The Sopranos,” the onset of a colder winter, and a burgeoning interest in fur among younger consumers. It’s quite a pivot from just a few years ago, when it appeared fur’s trajectory was on an unstoppable decline. Since the late 2010s, brands and retailers including Canada Goose, Gucci, Net-a-Porter, Versace, Prada, Neiman Marcus and Michael Kors all announced their intention to phase out fur products. In 2021, Israel became the first country in the world to enact a ban on new fur sales, while Italy and Norway announced they would stop fur farming. In 2021, Kering chief executive François-Henri Pinault said that fur had “no place in luxury.” Fast forward to 2024, and the sentiment around fur appears to be shifting as the mob wife aesthetic raises awareness of the material amongst a new generation of consumers. But this fur moment is different from the past. Now, it’s secondhand and fast fashion retailers that are reaping the benefits of fur’s viral moment, as are alternative material startups and brands with good quality faux fur offerings. On TikTok, trends can rise and fall within a matter of weeks, if not days, and “mob wife” is no exception. While weekly searches have grown by 21.3 percent year-on-year, data and retail analytics platform Trendalytics anticipates this fad to be short-lived, with an arc of roughly six months. “Mob wife is more of a reflection of the diminished meaning of trends and aesthetics,” said Mandy Lee, a trend analyst and forecaster. “We seem to be in this endless cycle of nostalgia for trends that were rooted in subcultures, values and context. Today, they are quite literally costumes that people put on and take off everyday.” Anticipating and preparing for these viral moments can be challenging for brands that don’t already have corresponding products and as fickle consumers are itching to hop on the bandwagon, selling products on a preorder model won’t work, said Lee. But brands that are at the right place at the right time can expect to earn dividends. In the case of the “mob wife” trend, because so many luxury labels have moved away from fur, it’s more likely to be fast fashion or mass market retailers who benefit. A faux fur jacket from Zara has emerged as one of the leading products benefitting from the trend, with searches and social interest in it and similar products seeing an increase of 212.7 percent in search and social buzz compared to last year, found Trendalytics. “Even though fur was once synonymous with luxury, fast fashion brands are well-positioned for this moment… selling on points of affordability and as a suitable alternative,” said Kayla Marci, senior retail analyst at Edited analytics. For those who want the real deal, vintage provides an option. On TikTok, users are encouraging the purchase of secondhand furs over new, making this viral moment key for vintage fur sellers like The Sil or even The RealReal. “Sales have exploded,” said Matsumoto. “We’ve never sold this many used garments before.” The mob wife trend may be destined to be short-lived, but the appetite for fur or fur-like materials will likely last. However, as fur’s popularity has shifted, consumers’ values around sustainability largely haven’t, creating an opportunity for next-generation material startups like plant-based fur brand BioFluff and Spiber, a Japanese biotech company using brewed protein-based fiber to create fur alternatives through a process similar to brewing beer. In the coming months, Spiber said they will partner with a number of brands to develop custom fur products. “We hope to underscore that you can have it both ways,” said Callie Clayton, head of global client relations at Spiber. “The look and feel of fur is possible without the cruelty.” Still, animal rights advocates aren’t happy with the material’s resurgence, arguing that even if it’s attained sustainably — via plant-based means, for example — the increased visibility of fur will inevitably stoke demand for the real thing.  PJ Smith of the Humane Society of the United States  is hopeful that legislation introduced in the last couple of years is robust enough to curb demand. “We can already see the end of the tunnel, the fur industry is dying thanks to policies like fur bans,” said Smith in an interview with the Business of Fashion. “Trends like these could lead to higher first sales but it won’t be enough to reverse the trajectory of the industry.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/style/mob-wives-aesthetic-fur-resurgence-bof/index.html,"edwardslowell fur ’ expect two thousand and twenty-three good year anticipation ban sale new fur

42,"‘Be fearless’: Taylor Swift will make it home for the Super Bowl, Japanese Embassy says","The James Webb Space Telescope has captured scintillating images of 19 spiral galaxies — and the millions of stars that call them home — in unprecedented detail never seen before by astronomers. Webb’s singular ability to observe the universe in different wavelengths of infrared light, such as near-infrared and mid-infrared, showcases the stars, gas and dust within the intricate structure of each galaxy. Astronomers believe that about 60% of all galaxies are spiral galaxies — and our solar system resides in one of the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy. Webb’s observations can help astronomers better understand star formation and the evolution of spiral galaxies like our own. Seen face-on, each galaxy in the new images has spiral arms laden with stars. The center of each galaxy features clusters of old stars or supermassive black holes. The observations were made as part of the PHANGS, or the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS, project. More than 100 astronomers around the world participate in the program, which also looks at data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the European Space Observatory’s Very Large Telescope’s MUSE instrument and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile. Data from the different telescopes enables astronomers to make observations across different wavelengths of visible, ultraviolet and radio light. Adding Webb’s infrared insights can help address some of the observational gaps. “Webb’s new images are extraordinary,” said Janice Lee, PHANGS core member and a project scientist for new missions and strategic initiatives at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, in a statement. “They’re mind-blowing even for researchers who have studied these same galaxies for decades. Bubbles and filaments are resolved down to the smallest scales ever observed, and tell a story about the star formation cycle.” Astronomers used Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera to observe millions of stars, seen in sparkling blue, grouped together in clusters and spread throughout the arms of the 19 galaxies as well. Meanwhile, Webb’s Mid-Infrared Instrument puts the spotlight on glowing dust surrounding the stars, as well as red still-forming stars cocooned in the very gas and dust that aids stellar growth. “These are where we can find the newest, most massive stars in the galaxies,” said Erik Rosolowsky, PHANGS core member and a professor of physics at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, in a statement. The spiral arms are practically incandescent with orange and red gas in Webb’s imagery. The images will be used to help astronomers determine the distribution of gas and dust in spiral galaxies, as well as how galaxies both nurture and cease the formation of stars. “These structures tend to follow the same pattern in certain parts of the galaxies,” Rosolowsky said. “We think of these like waves, and their spacing tells us a lot about how a galaxy distributes its gas and dust.” Webb also captured large, spherical shell-shaped voids among the galactic gas and dust that were likely sculpted by the explosions of stars. “These holes may have been created by one or more stars that exploded, carving out giant holes in the interstellar material,” said Adam Leroy, PHANGS core member and a professor of astronomy at the Ohio State University in Columbus, in a statement. Astronomers think that galaxies form from the inside out.  Star formation begins at the galactic center before rippling across the arms in a spiral. That means a star’s distance from the heart of the galaxy is relative to its age, so younger stars are likely farther from the galactic core. Groupings of blue stars near the centers of each galaxy indicate older stars. Meanwhile, some galaxies have pinkish-red spikes near their centers. “That’s a clear sign that there may be an active supermassive black hole,” said Eva Schinnerer, PHANGS core member and a staff scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, in a statement. “Or, the star clusters toward the center are so bright that they have saturated that area of the image.” Scientists are most excited about studying the massive number of stars revealed by Webb’s new images, according to Leroy. “Stars can live for billions or trillions of years,” Leroy said. “By precisely cataloging all types of stars, we can build a more reliable, holistic view of their life cycles.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/world/webb-spiral-galaxies-portrait-scn/index.html,james webb space telescope captured scintillating image nineteen spiral galaxy — million star call home — unprecedented detail never seen astronomer webb ’ singular ability observe universe different wavelength infrared light nearinfrared midinfrared showcase star gas dust within intricate structure galaxy astronomer believe sixty galaxy spiral galaxy — solar system resides one spiral arm milky way galaxy webb ’ observation help astronomer better understand star formation evolution spiral galaxy like seen faceon galaxy new image spiral arm laden star center galaxy feature cluster old star supermassive black hole observation made part phangs physic high angular resolution nearby galaxy project one hundred astronomer around world participate program also look data hubble space telescope european space observatory ’ large telescope ’ muse instrument atacama large millimetersubmillimeter array chile data different telescope enables astronomer make observation across different wavelength visible ultraviolet radio light adding webb ’ infrared insight help address observational gap “ webb ’ new image extraordinary ” said janice lee phangs core member project scientist new mission strategic initiative space telescope science institute baltimore statement “ ’ mindblowing even researcher studied galaxy decade bubble filament resolved smallest scale ever observed tell story star formation cycle ” astronomer used webb ’ nearinfrared camera observe million star seen sparkling blue grouped together cluster spread throughout arm nineteen galaxy well meanwhile webb ’ midinfrared instrument put spotlight glowing dust surrounding star well red stillforming star cocooned gas dust aid stellar growth “ find newest massive star galaxy ” said erik rosolowsky phangs core member professor physic university alberta edmonton statement spiral arm practically incandescent orange red gas webb ’ imagery image used help astronomer determine distribution gas dust spiral galaxy well galaxy nurture cease formation star “ structure tend follow pattern certain part galaxy ” rosolowsky said “ think like wave spacing tell u lot galaxy distributes gas dust ” webb also captured large spherical shellshaped void among galactic gas dust likely sculpted explosion star “ hole may created one star exploded carving giant hole interstellar material ” said adam leroy phangs core member professor astronomy ohio state university columbus statement astronomer think galaxy form inside star formation begin galactic center rippling across arm spiral mean star ’ distance heart galaxy relative age younger star likely farther galactic core grouping blue star near center galaxy indicate older star meanwhile galaxy pinkishred spike near center “ ’ clear sign may active supermassive black hole ” said eva schinnerer phangs core member staff scientist max planck institute astronomy heidelberg germany statement “ star cluster toward center bright saturated area image ” scientist excited studying massive number star revealed webb ’ new image according leroy “ star live billion trillion year ” leroy said “ precisely cataloging type star build reliable holistic view life cycle ”,8
43,Farmers’ protests have erupted across Europe. Here’s why,"A pigeon suspected of spying for China and held for eight months was released by Indian officials this week after intervention from animal rights organization PETA, the group said in a statement. “After learning that a pigeon was held at the Bai Sakarbai Dinshaw Petit Hospital for Animals (BSDPHA) in Parel as case property for an astonishing eight months, PETA India sprang into action to secure the bird’s freedom from captivity,” PETA said. The animal’s ordeal began in May last year, when it was captured near a port in Mumbai. There was a message written on the pigeon’s wings in words that appeared to be Chinese, PETA added. “This led to suspicion of spying and caused police to seize the bird, who was sent to Mumbai’s BSDPHA for a medical examination as part of an investigation.” CNN has reached out to Mumbai police for comment. Another pigeon was reportedly taken into custody in 2016 after authorities found it with a note that threatened Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In the most recent case, PETA contacted police in Mumbai “without further delay… to grant formal permission for the hospital to release the pigeon.” “The bird was released yesterday on the hospital premises by Colonel (Retd) Dr B. B. Kulkarni, Chief Medical Superintendent of the BSDPHA,” PETA said. Earlier Indian media reports had said that the bird had been transferred to the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, whose doctors set it free on Tuesday. CNN has reached out to Bombay SPCA for comment. While the pigeon’s case has made global headlines, “spy animals” captured and exploited by militaries are nothing new. In 2019, a snowy white beluga whale, later nicknamed Hvaldimir, shot to international fame after it was spotted wearing a specially made harness with mounts for a camera, leading experts to suggest the whale may have been trained by the Russian military. Belugas are social animals that hunt and travel together in pods. Hvaldimir the whale was found alone, and has been known to follow boats and play with those on board. He resurfaced in Swedish waters in 2023 and there have been concerns expressed by animal rights activists and marine experts about his fate.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/india/india-suspected-chinese-spy-pigeon-release-intl-hnk/index.html,pigeon suspected spying china held eight month released indian official week intervention animal right organization peta group said statement “ learning pigeon held bai sakarbai dinshaw petit hospital animal bsdpha parel case property astonishing eight month peta india sprang action secure bird ’ freedom captivity ” peta said animal ’ ordeal began may last year captured near port mumbai message written pigeon ’ wing word appeared chinese peta added “ led suspicion spying caused police seize bird sent mumbai ’ bsdpha medical examination part investigation ” cnn reached mumbai police comment another pigeon reportedly taken custody two thousand and sixteen authority found note threatened indian prime minister narendra modi recent case peta contacted police mumbai “ without delay… grant formal permission hospital release pigeon ” “ bird released yesterday hospital premise colonel retd dr b b kulkarni chief medical superintendent bsdpha ” peta said earlier indian medium report said bird transferred bombay society prevention cruelty animal whose doctor set free tuesday cnn reached bombay spca comment pigeon ’ case made global headline “ spy animal ” captured exploited military nothing new two thousand and nineteen snowy white beluga whale later nicknamed hvaldimir shot international fame spotted wearing specially made harness mount camera leading expert suggest whale may trained russian military beluga social animal hunt travel together pod hvaldimir whale found alone known follow boat play board resurfaced swedish water two thousand and twenty-three concern expressed animal right activist marine expert fate,9
44,TikTok CEO fires back at GOP senator pressing him about potential ties to China,"The consensus at the 2024 Republican National Committee winter meeting in Las Vegas this week was clear among the pro-Trump and anti-Trump factions alike: Donald Trump will be the party’s presidential nominee this year. “Let’s be honest about it. Trump is going to be the nominee of the Republican Party unless something drastic happens over the next few months,” said Alabama Republican Party chairman John Wahl. “And so with that in mind, yes, obviously the Democrats are already looking toward the general election. They’ve already started campaigning against Donald Trump. Republicans are ready to get there as well.” The confidence among the body of 168 RNC committee members reflected the former president’s dominance and enduring grip over much of the GOP.  Most members in attendance either said they are Trump supporters or pledged to support the party’s eventual nominee. Few, if any, publicly voiced support for Trump’s last remaining rival, Nikki Haley. “I would say not only that he’s going to be the nominee, but the RNC is at least if not more pro-Trump than the average Republican,” said Rob Steele, an RNC committee member from Michigan. Steele estimated that the 168-member body is now made up of 70% of people who became chairs and joined the committee since Trump was first nominated in 2016. Even as Trump nears the finish line of the Republican primary after neatly sweeping up victories in Iowa and New Hampshire last month, he is still facing four criminal indictments and is fighting a jury verdict in a civil defamation case. And Haley has vowed to stay in the race through her home state of South Carolina and beyond. But members voiced confidence in how the primary would play out and what needed to come after as they also voiced a sense of urgency for the primary to wrap itself up even if it were just nominally. The race between Trump and Haley will come to a head in South Carolina on February 24. Haley and her team have sought to close Trump’s lead in the state by highlighting her record as governor and reminding voters of her roots in the state, and she has sought to downplay the potential results in the state. But though South Carolina is Haley’s home state where she was elected twice to the top office, Trump has polled ahead of her there. He also has been endorsed by several politicians from the state, including Sens. Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, Gov. Henry McMaster, and Rep. Nancy Mace. Trump and his team have also made a point of scheduling fundraisers there to undercut what momentum Haley has had among deep pocketed donors. At the winter meeting, Republican committee members and chairs again and again voiced an eagerness for the South Carolina primary to happen and an indisputable nominee to emerge. “I think the process plays out how it’s going to play out but I think it’s coming to a conclusion sooner rather than later,” Florida Republican Party chairman Evan Power said in an interview. “I think when you look at what will happen if Democrats win. They can control everything. They’ll eliminate filibuster. They’ll pack the Supreme Court. We need to unite and get involved in this firefight as soon as possible.” The prospect of Trump clinching the 2024 Republican presidential nominee as he faces his criminal indictments has been looming over the party as the primary nears its end. Still, Shawn Steel, a RNC committee member from California, brushed off the danger of that scenario for the GOP ticket. Steel said Republicans should take comfort in the possibility that none of the major trials Trump faces will come up before the election. “There’s also the possibility of speculating that a meteorite shower would attack planet Earth and all of existence would go through a sixth major extinction …that would leave a mark no question about it,” Steel said. “But the good news is with all these possibilities, the legal consensus is none of these criminal trials are going to come up this year. That’s a fact of life. One civil trial might – one just did – and that doesn’t have the same force and effect.” That’s a sentiment that many RNC officials shared. “Unfortunately, the legal stuff is so out of line that it amounts to election interference,” Richard Porter, an RNC committee member from Illinois, said. “The cases are by and large ridiculous. So I don’t think people are persuaded by the merits of those cases. Still, other RNC committee members worry that the multiple court cases could distract from making the election about Biden’s record. “We would like the election to be a referendum on Biden’s failed presidency, but if we nominate Donald Trump, it will be about him rather than Biden,” Henry Barbour, a RNC committee member from Mississippi, said. Throughout the meeting, the target of open frustration about Republicans’ electoral woes or fundraising numbers has been directed away from Trump – to the frustration of some members. “The criticisms generally at (RNC chair Ronna McDaniel) are coming from Trumpers,” said Bill Palatucci, an RNC committee member from New Jersey who sometimes clashes with the more pro-Trump Republicans. “To me it’s pretty hypocritical and ironic that Ronna is taking criticisms.” With the primary largely settled to committee members, concerns throughout the four-day meeting, instead, focused on other topics. RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has made a point lately of trying to direct the party to get a better handle on addressing abortion, following a string of losses for the party in the post-Roe world criticisms. The theme from the meeting was not to make any gamble on the upcoming presidential election. Some committee members were given fake RNC poker chips and cards that read “Don’t Gamble on the result…Carefully vetted Rules [sic] are the Safest bet.” At the RNC winter meeting, the chairwoman showed three attack ads from Democrats on abortion to preview what Republicans should expect over the next year on the issue. She reiterated the points she had made recently, including that supporting blanket abortion bans without exceptions would spell doom for candidates, according to a source familiar with McDaniel’s remarks. Candidates and Republican campaigns needed to work to define themselves early on abortion rather than let Democrats do that, she contended. The meeting also highlighted how the pro-Trump wing has created conflict within the party.  The ongoing dispute between disparate factions of the state Republican Party was on broad display this week as both Kristina Karamo, the ousted chair of the Michigan GOP, and her replacement, former Ambassador Pete Hoekstra, were both credentialed as guests. Neither were fully recognized as the official chair or could vote as other chairs. Critics among the RNC committee people also took aim at McDaniel’s handling of the organization’s budget and finances. That frustration came to a breaking point with a vote over a resolution that tried to add stipulations on what could go into the RNC budget – a move meant to handcuff the chair. That resolution failed decisively, according to a Republican in the room. Party leaders have become increasingly vocal in condemning conservative critics of the RNC and whether it is prepared for the toughest months of the 2024 election cycle. When Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo delivered a speech on Thursday, he made a point of saying he had no patience “with actors taking misleading shots at the RNC” and highlighted the “critical role the RNC played in his election,” according to a Republican that attended that speech. Lombardo, who flipped control of the Nevada governor’s mansion in 2022, emphasized in his speech the importance of matching a campaign’s message to the state or district that campaign is competing in, according to another Republican that attended his winter committee meeting speech. “He was basically saying everybody needs to quit complaining and beat Democrats,” a committee member who attended the speech said.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/politics/rnc-meeting-trump-nominee/index.html,consensus two thousand and twenty-four republican national committee winter meeting la vega week clear

45,"The world’s best beaches, according to Lonely Planet","An intense, long-lasting atmospheric river is moving into California Sunday, bringing the potential for “life-threatening” flooding, mudslides and widespread power outages as it dumps heavy rain and snow. Follow our live coverage here. This is what’s happening: • Rare high risk for flooding: A rare Level 4 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall was expanded Sunday to include Los Angeles, in addition to Santa Barbara and Oxnard in Southern California, with the weather prediction center warning of “life threatening flash and urban flash flooding.” Rainfall rates up to an inch per hour will bring 3 to 6 inches of rain across the area. A more widespread Level 3 risk exists for much of coastal California, including San Francisco. • A month’s worth of rain possible in Los Angeles: In Central and Southern California, widespread rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected – more than a month’s worth of rain for most. There are indications the storm may be as strong as Tropical Storm Hilary from last August, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said during a news conference Friday, and encouraged residents to take “common sense precautions.” • Some residents told to evacuate: Mandatory evacuation orders have been issued for communities in Santa Barbara, San José, Los Angeles and Ventura County. Officials warned residents of potential “life-threatening” floods and landslides from the atmospheric event. Several school districts in Santa Barbara County have also canceled classes on Monday due to the severe weather. • First ever hurricane force wind warning: The National Weather Service in San Francisco on Sunday issued its first ever hurricane force wind warning since records have been kept. Widespread winds of 40 to 60 mph are expected throughout the state, with some gusts as high as 95 mph in the foothills and mountains. Wind advisories and high wind warnings are in effect for nearly 30 million people in inland areas across nearly the entire state from Redding to San Diego. • “Near impossible” travel in the mountains: The storm is also expected to bring significant snowfall totals in eastern California and along the Nevada border. Heavy wet snow will spread across the Sierra Nevada through Monday with accumulation rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour, according to the weather service. Dangerous wind gusts are expected to produce whiteout conditions making travel above 5000-6000 feet “near impossible,” the weather service said. • Power outages growing: More than 800,000 customers are without power in California, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us, with outages rapidly rising, particularly along the coast, as rain and strong winds move in. The blackouts are expected to increase, especially in central and southern portions of California as wind gusts get stronger throughout the evening and into tomorrow. • Rain and wind cause flight delays: At least 143 flights into, and 122 flights out of San Francisco International Airport have been delayed, according to the tracking website FlightAware. At least 100 flights were cancelled Sunday. • Sporting events affected: Both NASCAR and PGA canceled events scheduled in California over the weekend due to the severe weather. NASCAR moved the Busch Light Clash at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from Sunday to Saturday night, and the PGA Tour announced it would postpone Sunday’s final round of the Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf tournament, to Monday. This atmospheric river – a long, narrow moisture band that carries saturated air thousands of miles then discharges it like a fire hose – comes right on the heels of another storm that brought record rainfall to most of California, including Los Angeles. But this storm is much slower and is expected to stall as it moves onshore, bringing a much longer duration of rain compared to the first. The worst of the storm will fall between Sunday and Tuesday, according to the weather service. Parts of the central and southern coastline of the state are expected to see the most significant amounts of rain and flooding. This includes the Los Angeles and San Diego metro areas. Combined with the 2.49 inches that fell in Los Angeles on Thursday, the city could potentially receive almost a year’s worth of rain in the first week of February alone. “This damaging flooding will be a threat to lives and property,” Eric Schoening with the National Weather Service said at a news briefing Saturday. “Please, if you come across a flooded roadway, we urge you to turn around, don’t drown.” Many roads could flood and there could be major rises on creeks, streams and rivers, as well as mud and rock slides and debris flows, Schoening added. Already Sunday, the National Weather Service in San Francisco reported a landslide in the city. And in Santa Barbara more than 300 miles south, the storm triggered “extremely high winds,” flooding and toppled trees, Santa Barbara Police Department Sgt. Ethan Ragsdale told CNN. At least 8 inches of rain can fall in less than 24 hours in parts of the Transverse Ranges in Southern California, with over 10 inches possible in some areas, the prediction center cautioned. California Gov. Gavin Newsom visited the state’s operations center in Mather on Sunday to receive an update on the latest weather forecasts and the state’s response efforts. Newsom’s office announced Friday the state has 1,200 pieces of winter equipment available to remove snow and ice from roads, 21 swift water rescue teams on standby and California National Guard members ready to deploy rapidly. More than 7 million sandbags have been prepositioned and the state is prepared to provide shelter and food for more than 37,000 people. Speaking on CNN Newsroom on Sunday, Tony Tavares, director of the California Department of Transportation, said his department is “coordinating across multiple state departments, regional and local agencies to ensure the safety of all Californians. This includes prepositioning over 4,000 personnel and storm equipment such as portable pumps and generators across the state,” Tavares said. Tavares described the department’s efforts as “all hands on deck,” as some crews in Northern California monitor wildfire burn scar areas, others deal with the snow and ice in the mountains, and crews along the southern coast watch for heavy flooding. More than 8,500 personnel, including swift water and helicopter rescue teams, have been deployed statewide to respond to any potential calls for help, said Nancy Ward, director of the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services. “These next storms are going to be impactful and dangerous,” Ward said at a news briefing Saturday. “They’re the most dangerous natural disasters that we have, killing more people from storm damages and flooding than wildfires every year.” The impact from powerful onshore winds will be felt across northern and central California through Sunday, eventually shifting to southern California into Sunday night, the National Weather Service said. Wind advisories and high wind warnings stretch across pretty much the entire state of California from Redding down through San Diego affecting nearly 30 million people.

46,She traveled every New York City subway line — and photographed every first and last stop,"Trees are believed to have originated hundreds of millions of years ago. Ever since, evidence of these ancient plant sentinels has been in short supply. Now, a new discovery of uniquely 3D tree fossils has opened a window into what the world was like when the planet’s early forests were beginning to evolve, expanding our understanding of the architecture of trees throughout Earth’s history. Five tree fossils buried alive by an earthquake 350 million years ago were found in a quarry in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, according to a study published Friday in the journal Current Biology. The authors said these new and unusual fossil trees not only bear a surprising shape reminiscent of a Dr. Seuss illustration, they reveal clues about a period of life on Earth of which we know little. “They are time capsules,” said Robert Gastaldo, a paleontologist and sedimentologist who led the study, “literally little windows into deep-time landscapes and ecosystems.” Coauthors Olivia King and Matthew Stimson unearthed the first of the ancient trees in 2017 while doing fieldwork in a rock quarry in New Brunswick. One of the specimens they discovered is among a handful of cases in the entire plant fossil record — spanning more than 400 million years — in which a tree’s branches and crown leaves are still attached to its trunk. Few tree fossils that date back to Earth’s earliest forests have ever been found, according to Gastaldo. Their discovery helps fill in some missing pieces of an incomplete fossil record. “There are only five or six trees that we can document, at least in the Paleozoic, that were preserved with its crown intact,” said Gastaldo, a professor of geology at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. Most ancient tree specimens are relatively small, he noted, and often discovered in the form of a fossilized trunk with a stump or root system attached. For his colleagues to find a preserved tree that could have been 15 feet tall in its maturity with an 18-foot diameter crown left the paleontologist “gobsmacked.” The researchers excavated the first fossil tree about seven years ago, but it took another few years before four more specimens of the same plant were found in close proximity to one another. Dubbed “Sanfordiacaulis,” the newly identified species was named in honor of Laurie Sanford, the owner of the quarry where the trees were unearthed. The forms taken by these previously unknown 350 million-year-old plants look somewhat like a modern-day fern or palm, per the study, despite the fact that those tree species didn’t appear until 300 million years later. But while the tops of ferns or palms as we know them boast few leaves, the most complete specimen of the newly discovered fossils has more than 250 leaves preserved around its trunk, with each partially preserved leaf extending around 5.7 feet (1.7 meters). That fossil is encased in a sandstone boulder and roughly the size of a small car, according to Stimson, an assistant curator of geology and paleontology at the New Brunswick Museum. The unique fossilization of the cluster of trees is likely due to a “catastrophic” earthquake-induced landslide that took place in an ancient rift lake, he said. “These trees were alive when the earthquake happened. They were buried very quickly, very rapidly after that, at the bottom of the lake, and then the lake (went) back to normal,” Stimson said. Finding complete fossil trees is rare and much less common than finding a complete dinosaur, according to Peter Wilf, a professor of geosciences and paleobotanist at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved with the study. Wilf noted via email that the “unusual” new fossil tree was a relic of a time period from which there are almost no tree fossils. “The new fossils are a milestone in our understanding of how early forest structure evolved, eventually leading to the complex rainforest architectures that support most of Earth’s living biodiversity,” Wilf added. To King, a research associate at the New Brunswick Museum who found the group of fossils, the Sanfordiacaulis would have looked like something plucked straight out of Dr. Seuss’ most popular works. “You know in ‘The Lorax,’ the trees have these big pom-poms at the top and narrow trunks? These probably have a similar structure. You have this massive crown at the top, and then it does narrow and paper into this very small trunk,” King said. “It’s a very Dr. Seuss-looking tree. It’s a weird and wonderful idea of what this thing could look like.” But the reign of the Sanfordiacaulis was short-lived, the researchers said. “We do not see this architecture of plant again,” Stimson told CNN. He noted that it grew in the early Carboniferous, a time period at the end of the Paleozoic Era when plants and animals were diversifying as they started to make their way from water to land. Much of evolution is experimental, with success often measured by a species’ versatility, or ability to adapt to many different places and conditions. The peculiar set of tree fossils presents proof of a “failed experiment of science and evolution,” Stimson added. “We’re really starting to paint that picture as to what life was like 350 million years ago.” Fossils such as the Sanfordiacaulis are not just useful in helping humans understand how life changed in the past, they can help scientists figure out where life on our planet might be headed next. The existence of this particular species suggests that trees of the period were starting to occupy different ecological niches beyond what was previously understood, according to the researchers behind its discovery. Gastaldo sees this as an indication that plants — much like early invertebrates — were experimenting with how they adapted to the environment. The earthquake that likely led to the trees’ fossilization also offers new geological evidence of what may have been occurring in Earth’s systems at the same moment in time. “This is really the first evidence we have of (a tree) that would be between what grows on the ground and what would tower way above the ground,” Gastaldo said. “What else was there?”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/world/sanfordiacaulis-ancient-tree-fossils-discovery-scn/index.html,tree believed originated hundred million year ago ever since evidence ancient plant sentinel short supply new discovery uniquely 3d tree fossil opened window world like planet ’ early forest beginning evolve expanding understanding architecture tree throughout earth ’ history five tree fossil buried alive earthquake three hundred and fifty million year ago found quarry canadian province new brunswick according study published friday journal current biology author said new unusual fossil tree bear surprising shape reminiscent dr seuss illustration reveal clue period life earth know little “ time capsule ” said robert gastaldo paleontologist sedimentologist led study “ literally little window deeptime landscape ecosystem ” coauthor olivia king matthew stimson unearthed first ancient tree two thousand and seventeen fieldwork rock quarry new brunswick one specimen discovered among handful case entire plant fossil record — spanning four hundred million year — tree ’ branch crown leaf still attached trunk tree fossil date back earth ’ earliest forest ever found according gastaldo discovery help fill missing piece incomplete fossil record “ five six tree document least paleozoic preserved crown intact ” said gastaldo professor geology colby college waterville maine ancient tree specimen relatively small noted often discovered form fossilized trunk stump root system attached colleague find preserved tree could fifteen foot tall maturity 18foot diameter crown left paleontologist “ gobsmacked ” researcher excavated first fossil tree seven year ago took another year four specimen plant found close proximity one another dubbed “ sanfordiacaulis ” newly identified specie named honor laurie sanford owner quarry tree unearthed form taken previously unknown three hundred and fifty millionyearold plant look somewhat like modernday fern palm per study despite fact tree specie ’ appear three hundred million year later top fern palm know boast leaf complete specimen newly discovered fossil two hundred and fifty leaf preserved around trunk partially preserved leaf extending around fifty-seven foot seventeen meter fossil encased sandstone boulder roughly size small car according stimson assistant curator geology paleontology new brunswick museum unique fossilization cluster tree likely due “ catastrophic ” earthquakeinduced landslide took place ancient rift lake said “ tree alive earthquake happened buried quickly rapidly bottom lake lake went back normal ” stimson said finding complete fossil tree rare much le common finding complete dinosaur according peter wilf professor geosciences paleobotanist pennsylvania state university involved study wilf noted via email “ unusual ” new fossil tree relic time period almost tree fossil “ new fossil milestone understanding early forest structure evolved eventually leading complex rainforest architecture support earth ’ living biodiversity ” wilf added king research associate new brunswick museum found group fossil sanfordiacaulis would looked like something plucked straight dr seuss ’ popular work “ know ‘ lorax ’ tree big pompoms top narrow trunk probably similar structure massive crown top narrow paper small trunk ” king said “ ’ dr seusslooking tree ’ weird wonderful idea thing could look like ” reign sanfordiacaulis shortlived researcher said “ see architecture plant ” stimson told cnn noted grew early carboniferous time period end paleozoic era plant animal diversifying started make way water land much evolution experimental success often measured specie ’ versatility ability adapt many different place condition peculiar set tree fossil present proof “ failed experiment science evolution ” stimson added “ ’ really starting paint picture life like three hundred and fifty million year ago ” fossil sanfordiacaulis useful helping human understand life changed past help scientist figure life planet might headed next existence particular specie suggests tree period starting occupy different ecological niche beyond previously understood according researcher behind discovery gastaldo see indication plant — much like early invertebrate — experimenting adapted environment earthquake likely led tree ’ fossilization also offer new geological evidence may occurring earth ’ system moment time “ really first evidence tree would grows ground would tower way ground ” gastaldo said “ else ”,1
47,Rare ancient tree discovery has scientists ‘gobsmacked’,"After losing her house to a fire, Jo Ann Ussery had a peculiar idea: to live in an airplane. She bought an old Boeing 727 that was destined for the scrapyard, had it shipped to a plot of land she already owned, and spent six months renovating, doing most of the work by herself. By the end, she had a fully functional home, with over 1,500 square feet of living space, three bedrooms, two bathrooms and even a hot tub – where the cockpit used to be. All for less than $30,000, or about $60,000 in today’s money. Ussery – a beautician from Benoit, Mississippi – had no professional connection to aviation, and was following the offbeat suggestion of her brother-in-law, an air traffic controller. She lived in the plane from 1995 to 1999, when it was irreparably damaged after falling off the truck that was moving it to a different location nearby, where it would have been open for public display. Although she wasn’t the first person to ever live in an airplane, her flawless execution of the project had an inspirational effect. In the late 1990s, Bruce Campbell, an electrical engineer with a private pilot license, was awestruck by her story: “I was driving home and listening to [the radio,] and they had Jo Ann’s story, and it was amazing I didn’t drive off the road because my focus turned entirely to it. And the next morning I was placing phone calls,” he says. Campbell has now been living in his own plane – also a Boeing 727 – for over 20 years, in the woods of Hillsboro, Oregon: “I still stand on Jo Ann’s shoulder and I’m grateful for the proof of concept.” He has no regrets: “I would never live in a conventional home. No chance. If Scotty beamed me to inner Mongolia, erased my fingerprints and forced me to live in a conventional structure, I’d do what I have to do to survive – but otherwise, it’s a jetliner for me anytime.” That’s not to say he wouldn’t do anything differently: “I made a lot of mistakes, including the whopper-class one: partnering with a salvage firm. Avoiding that and using superior transport logistics renders the costs much lower,” he explains. His project cost $220,000 in total (about $380,000 in today’s money), of which roughly half was for the purchase of the plane. He says the plane belonged to Olympic Airways in Greece and was even used to transport the remains of the airline’s magnate owner, Aristotle Onassis, in 1975: “I didn’t know the plane’s history at the time. And I didn’t know that it had an old, 707-style interior. It was really, really awful compared to modern standards. It was functional but it just looked old and crude. Maybe the worst choice for a home.” As a result, Campbell had to work on the plane for a couple of years before being able to live in it. The interiors are no-frills, with a primitive shower made out of a plastic cylinder and a futon sofa for a bed. During the harshest part of winter Campbell traditionally retreats to Miyazaki, a city in southern Japan with subtropical weather where he owns a small apartment. But the pandemic has made this difficult, and for the past three years he’s been living in the 727 year-round. Intending to set up an airplane home in Japan as well, in 2018 he says he almost bought a second aircraft – a 747-400 – but the deal fell out at the last minute, because the airline (which Campbell won’t reveal) decided to keep the aircraft in service for longer than expected: “We had to put the project on hold and it stands that way to this day,” he says. Campbell frequently gets visitors and even offers lodging in the aircraft free of charge, while in the summer he hosts larger public events with funfair attractions: “Artists perform on the right wing, guests dance in front or behind the wing in the forest, which for the big concerts becomes filled with all sorts of recreational venues. They’re not Disneyland class – just portable booths with different curiosities and little recreations, but they’re fun.” If you think living in an airplane is extravagant enough, how about living in two? That’s the plan for Joe Axline, who owns an MD-80 and DC-9, sitting next to each other in a plot of land in Brookshire, Texas. Axline has lived in the MD-80 for over a decade – after getting divorced on April Fool’s Day in 2011 – and is planning to renovate the DC-8 and equip it with recreational areas such as a movie theater and a music room. He calls his grand plan “Project Freedom.” “I’ve got less than a quarter of a million dollars in the whole project,” says Axline, who has very few running expenses because he owns the land and has built his own water well and sewer system: “The only thing that I have still left is electricity,” he adds. For years, he even shared the plane with his children: “The kids are gone now, so it’s just me. Living in a house, you have a lot of space, but it’s all wasted space. My master bedroom is 10 feet by 18, which is not a bad size for a bedroom. I’ve got two TVs in it, plenty of space to walk around. My living room is good-sized, the dining room seats four, I can cook enough food for a whole bunch of people if they come over. I also have a shower and a toilet, so I don’t have to get out of the airplane to go to the restroom. The only thing that I don’t have here that I would have in a house is windows that open,” he explains, adding that he just opens the plane’s doors to let fresh air in. The planes are visible from nearby roads, and Axline says that many drivers – their curiosity piqued – end up stopping by: “I have three or four people every single day. I call them my turistas,” he says. “They drive by and think, it’s so cool. Most of the time I wave them all over. I’ll say, if you got some time, I’ll give you a tour. And if I didn’t make the bed that day, who cares? Let’s see how real people live.” Axline too was interested in a Boeing 747 – living in the “Queen of the Skies” is the airplane homeowner’s ultimate dream – but he gave up when he was confronted with the shipping costs: “The airplane itself was about $300,000, but the shipping cost was $500,000. Half a million dollars to move it. That’s because you can’t drive it through the roads, you’d have to tear it apart, cut it up, slice it and dice it and then put it back together.” There are other notable examples of airplanes converted to homes. One of the earliest is a Boeing 307 Stratoliner once owned by billionaire and film director Howard Hughes, who spent a fortune remodeling the interior to turn it into a “Flying Penthouse.” After being damaged by a hurricane, it was turned into an extravagant motoryacht and eventually purchased in the 1980s by Florida resident Dave Drimmer, who extensively renovated it and renamed it “The Cosmic Muffin.” He lived in the plane-boat hybrid for 20 years, before eventually donating it to the Florida Air Museum in 2018. American country singer and Nashville Hall of Famer Red Lane, who had a past as a plane mechanic, lived for decades in a converted DC-8 that he saved from the scrapyard in the late 1970s. Lane, who passed away in 2015, also had no regrets: “I have never, ever woke up in this place wishing I was somewhere else,” he revealed in a 2006 TV interview. Those who want to experience a night or two in an airplane home have a few options in the form of hotels; in Costa Rica, the Costa Verde hotel boasts a fully refurbished Boeing 727 – complete with two bedrooms and an ocean view terrace; in Sweden, Jumbo Stay is a hotel built entirely inside a Boeing 747, sitting on the grounds of Stockholm’s Arlanda Airport. And if you’re just looking to party, there’s another Boeing 747 that can be hired for events with up to 220 people, at Cotswold Airport in England, about 100 miles west of London. If you want to leave transitional housing behind and fully take to life inside a fuselage, however, you must be ready for challenges: “You’ve got to have a passion for wanting to do this, because there’ll be so many problems that you’ll need to address that it can become overwhelming,” says Joe Axline, who lists sourcing the right airframe and finding a suitable location for it among the biggest hurdles. That is perhaps why several of Bruce Campbell’s visitors over the years expressed interest in adopting this lifestyle, but none ever turned the dream into reality: “I think it’s pretty difficult for people: a few of my guests left convinced they wanted to do it and I sent them articulated instructions to help them along step by step, but none have established momentum,” he says. But don’t let that discourage you, Campbell adds: “My primary advice is do it. Don’t let anybody shake your confidence. Work out all the logistics, and just do it.”",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/people-living-in-planes/index.html,"losing house fire jo ann ussery peculiar idea live airplane bought old boeing seven

48,An Atlanta attorney was sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife after a weekend getaway. Now he may soon be released,"A finance worker at a multinational firm was tricked into paying out $25 million to fraudsters using deepfake technology to pose as the company’s chief financial officer in a video conference call, according to Hong Kong police. The elaborate scam saw the worker duped into attending a video call with what he thought were several other members of staff, but all of whom were in fact deepfake recreations, Hong Kong police said at a briefing on Friday. “(In the) multi-person video conference, it turns out that everyone [he saw] was fake,”  senior superintendent Baron Chan Shun-ching told the city’s public broadcaster RTHK. Chan said the worker had grown suspicious after he received a message that was purportedly from the company’s UK-based chief financial officer. Initially, the worker suspected it was a phishing email, as it talked of the need for a secret transaction to be carried out. However, the worker put aside his early doubts after the video call because other people in attendance had looked and sounded just like colleagues he recognized, Chan said. Believing everyone else on the call was real, the worker agreed to remit a total of $200 million Hong Kong dollars – about $25.6 million, the police officer added. The case is one of several recent episodes in which fraudsters are believed to have used deepfake technology to modify publicly available video and other footage to cheat people out of money. At the press briefing Friday, Hong Kong police said they had made six arrests in connection with such scams. Chan said that eight stolen Hong Kong identity cards – all of which had been reported as lost by their owners – were used to make 90 loan applications and 54 bank account registrations between July and September last year. On at least 20 occasions, AI deepfakes had been used to trick facial recognition programs by imitating the people pictured on the identity cards, according to police. The scam involving the fake CFO was only discovered when the employee later checked with the corporation’s head office. Hong Kong police did not reveal the name or details of the company or the worker. Authorities across the world are growing increasingly concerned at the sophistication of deepfake technology and the nefarious uses it can be put to. At the end of January, pornographic, AI-generated images of the American pop star Taylor Swift spread across social media, underscoring the damaging potential posed by artificial intelligence technology. The photos - which show the singer in sexually suggestive and explicit positions - were viewed tens of millions of times before being removed from social platforms.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html,finance worker multinational firm tricked paying twenty-five million fraudsters using deepfake technology pose company ’ chief financial officer video conference call according hong kong police elaborate scam saw worker duped attending video call thought several member staff fact deepfake recreation hong kong police said briefing friday “ multiperson video conference turn everyone saw fake ” senior superintendent baron chan shunching told city ’ public broadcaster rthk chan said worker grown suspicious received message purportedly company ’ ukbased chief financial officer initially worker suspected phishing email talked need secret transaction carried however worker put aside early doubt video call people attendance looked sounded like colleague recognized chan said believing everyone else call real worker agreed remit total two hundred million hong kong dollar – two hundred and fifty-six million police officer added case one several recent episode fraudsters believed used deepfake technology modify publicly available video footage cheat people money press briefing friday hong kong police said made six arrest connection scam chan said eight stolen hong kong identity card – reported lost owner – used make ninety loan application fifty-four bank account registration july september last year least twenty occasion ai deepfakes used trick facial recognition program imitating people pictured identity card according police scam involving fake cfo discovered employee later checked corporation ’ head office hong kong police reveal name detail company worker authority across world growing increasingly concerned sophistication deepfake technology nefarious us put end january pornographic aigenerated image american pop star taylor swift spread across social medium underscoring damaging potential posed artificial intelligence technology photo show singer sexually suggestive explicit position viewed ten million time removed social platform,4
49,‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ begins the end of Larry David’s show for people who hate people,"Holiday shoppers powered strong revenue growth for Amazon last quarter, the company said Thursday, the same day it launched a new AI shopping assistant. The e-commerce leader on Thursday reported revenue of $170 billion for its quarter ending in December, beating Wall Street’s estimates and growing 14% compared to the same period last year. And the company is now looking to give customers a new way to shop, while signaling to investors that it is doubling down on artificial intelligence. Ahead of the earnings report on Thursday, Amazon announced it was adding an AI-powered shopping assistant dubbed “Rufus” to its e-commerce store. Rufus is “trained on our very expansive product catalog, as well as our community q&a, and customer reviews, and the broader web,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts. “It lets customers discover items in a very different way than they have been able to on an e-commerce website.” Rufus launched in beta on Thursday to a small subset of customers on Amazon’s app but will roll out to additional US customers in the coming weeks. Amazon also reported quarterly profits of some $10.6 billion on Thursday. Amazon’s profits during this past holiday quarter also come as its business enters 2024 in much better shape than a year ago. At the start of 2023, the company was navigating geopolitical uncertainty, macroeconomic headwinds and higher inflationary pressures as well as a whiplash in pandemic-induced demand for e-commerce. Since late 2022, CEO Jassy has been conducting aggressive cost-cutting measures, including multiple rounds of mass layoffs. Some of the layoffs at Amazon have continued this year. This past quarter marked “a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon,” Jassy said in a statement accompanying the earnings. The company’s stock jumped more than 7% in after-hours trading Thursday immediately after reporting earnings. “The bottom line is that despite all the concerns plaguing the tech sector, Amazon has managed to perform surprisingly well,” Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com said in a note Thursday evening. “The results indicate that ongoing cost-cutting measures are having a positive impact on Amazon’s business prospects.” Amazon Web Services, a longtime money maker for the company, saw revenue climb 13% last quarter to $24.2 billion. Jassy has also spent the past year signaling to investors that the company is investing heavily in generative AI technology, so as not to be left behind amid an AI arms race in the tech sector. Jassy has said previously that he forecasts generative AI will lead to “tens of billions of dollars of revenue for AWS” in the coming years.

50,The super-rich are buying more ultra-customized Rolls-Royces and Lamborghinis,"Microscopic fragments of protein and DNA recovered from bones discovered in 8-meter-deep cave dirt have revealed Neanderthals and humans likely lived alongside one another in northern Europe as far back as 45,000 years ago. The genetic analysis of the fossils, which were found in a cave near the town of Ranis in eastern Germany, suggested that modern humans were the makers of distinctive, leaf-shaped stone tools that archaeologists once believed were crafted by Neanderthals, the heavily built hominins who lived in Europe until about 40,000 years ago. Modern humans, or homo sapiens, weren’t previously known to have lived as far north as the region where the tools were made. “The Ranis cave site provides evidence for the first dispersal of Homo sapiens across the higher latitudes of Europe. It turns out that stone artifacts that were thought to be produced by Neanderthals were, in fact, part of the early Homo sapiens toolkit,” said research author Jean-Jacques Hublin, a professor at the Collège de France in Paris and emeritus director at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, in a news release. “This fundamentally changes our previous knowledge about the period: Homo sapiens reached northwestern Europe long before Neanderthal disappearance in southwestern Europe.” The discovery means the two groups, who once interbred and left most humans alive today with traces of Neanderthal DNA, may have overlapped for several thousand years. It also shows that Homo sapiens, our species, crossed the Alps into the cold climes of northern and central Europe earlier than thought. Three studies detailing the discoveries and lab analysis were published Wednesday in the journals Nature and Nature Ecology & Evolution. The style of stone tool found at Ranis has also been discovered elsewhere across Europe, from Moravia and eastern Poland to the British Isles, according to the studies. Archaeologists call the tool style Lincombian-Ranisian-Jerzmanowician, or LRJ, in reference to the places where it was first identified. To identify who made the artifacts, the team excavated Ilsenhöhle cave near Ranis from 2016 to 2022. When the cave was first excavated in the 1930s, only the tools were found and analyzed. This time around the team was able to dig deeper and more systematically, ultimately uncovering human fossils there for the first time. “The challenge was to excavate the full 8-metre sequence from top to bottom, hoping that some deposits were left from the 1930s excavation,” said study coauthor Marcel Weiss, a researcher at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in a statement. “We were fortunate to find a 1.7 metre thick rock the previous excavators did not get past. After removing that rock by hand, we finally uncovered the LRJ layers and even found human fossils.” However, the human remains weren’t immediately identifiable among the hundreds of bone fragments unearthed during the six-year dig. It was only later the team knew definitively that the layers of sediment that contained the LRJ stone tools also included humans remains. The researchers used proteins extracted from bone fragments to identify animal and human remains they found, a technique known as palaeoproteomics. It allows scientists to identify human and animal bones when their form is unclear or uncertain. Using the same technique, the team also managed to identify human remains among bones excavated during the 1930s. However, the protein analysis was only able to identify the bones as belonging to hominins — a category that includes Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis, or Neanderthals. To distinguish between the two, the team was able to extract fragments of ancient DNA from the 13 human fossils they identified. “We confirmed that the skeletal fragments belonged to Homo sapiens,” said study coauthor Elena Zavala, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in the release. “Interestingly, several fragments shared the same mitochondrial DNA sequences — even fragments from different excavations,” Zavala added. “This indicates that the fragments belonged to the same individual or were maternal relatives, linking these new finds with the ones from decades ago.” Radiocarbon dating of the fossils and other artifacts in the cave suggested that these early humans were living there from around 45,000 years ago, making them the earliest Homo sapiens known to have inhabited northwestern Europe. The region would have had a dramatically different climate then, with conditions typical of steppe tundra such as that found in present-day Siberia. The dig revealed the presence of reindeer, cave bears, woolly rhinoceroses and horses. The researchers also concluded that hibernating cave bears and denning hyenas primarily used the cave, which had only periodic human presence. “This shows that even these earlier groups of Homo sapiens dispersing across Eurasia already had some capacity to adapt to such harsh climatic conditions,” said coauthor Sarah Pederzani, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of La Laguna in Spain, who led the paleoclimate study of the site. “Until recently, it was thought that resilience to cold-climate conditions did not appear until several thousand years later, so this is a fascinating and surprising result,” she said, according to the news release. William E. Banks, a researcher at the University of Bordeaux in France, said the studies showed how new methods are allowing archaeologists to examine sites in unprecedented detail, improving the ability to pinpoint when a site was occupied. The “discoveries provide another important piece of the puzzle of this culturally and demographically complex period in Europe,” Banks noted in a commentary published alongside the studies. However, Banks, who wasn’t involved in the research, added that archaeologists “must be careful not to generalize findings from one or two sites.” He noted that recent discoveries suggested Neanderthals were more culturally and cognitively complex than popular stereotypes suggest and that archaeologists should “not necessarily assume” in all cases that modern humans made more complex styles of stone tools from that pivotal period before Neanderthals disappeared.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/europe/ancient-tools-humans-neanderthals-europe-scn/index.html,microscopic fragment

51,Floating sauna saves people from sinking Tesla,"In April 2023, George Fox was gearing up for the adventure of a lifetime: a three-year cruise taking him around the world. The departure was set for Life at Sea’s inaugural cruise, slated to leave Istanbul on November 1. There was just one problem: His bank refused to wire his payment. “I told them I needed to make a foreign transaction wire, and I had to tell them what it was for,” says Fox. “My bank told me they didn’t want to do it. They said, ‘It’s too risky.’ I couldn’t believe it. “I said it was my money, but they said, ‘It’s coming from our bank.’ They were acting on my behalf.” In the end, they agreed. Fox’s bank asked him to research Miray Cruises, the Turkey-based company that was launching the Life at Sea project after 30-odd years of cruising around the Mediterranean. “It took a week or two – I had to find out the names of the owners and do a lot of research, but they finally acquiesced,” he says. Today, Fox is one of more than 100 would-be passengers waiting for a refund from Miray, which canceled the cruise just two weeks before its delayed departure date. In all, he says he paid $70,000 of the $230,000 total fee for three years in an external cabin. Others say they spent more. One would-be passenger CNN spoke with says they are more than $300,000 down. When canceling, Life at Sea vowed to refund passengers in full. Payments were to be made in three monthly tranches, with the first to be completed by December 22, according to company emails seen by CNN. But now, after two of three payments should have arrived, passengers say that only a handful have seen any money, and no one has got what they were expecting. The company doesn’t deny problems with repayment, and it now says that customers will be reimbursed in full by February 15. The majority, including Fox, have not even seen a dollar, passengers tell CNN. The high hopes and eventual failure of the Life at Sea cruise reads a bit like a Greek tragedy. Over the past 10 months, as it went from dream to nightmare, CNN has been in contact with around 20 would-be passengers. Some say they always feared the cruise would be canceled, but they signed up anyway – the dream was too alluring. Some think it was a scam; others think the company simply couldn’t afford to buy the ship. Some hope they might see their money back. Others think it was as good as gone as soon as they spent it. Hearing their stories, two months after the cruise was abruptly canceled, sheds light on why so many booked – some even selling their homes and property to do so. So what happened? In March 2023, Miray launched its Life at Sea concept: 1,095 days sailing around the world in a floating apartment block. The idea of a long-term, round-the-world cruise wasn’t new, but Life at Sea’s relative affordability – fares started at $30,000 per person per year, including accommodation, food, drinks, laundry and even health care – made waves. For many people, the idea of living in a small cabin is the stuff of nightmares. But for the passengers who’d signed up to fill 111 cabins of the Life at Sea vessel, it seemed perfect. Some were experienced cruisers. Others, such as Meredith Shay, had never set foot on a ship. Shay made headlines as the first person to sign up. A retired flight attendant, travel is in her blood, and cruising around the world sounded a lot more relaxing – and affordable – than flying. “The concept of being in one room and not having to jump onto airplanes was very enticing,” she says now. Shay had already been thinking about long-term cruising when Life at Sea first launched. While Miray was by no means the first company to offer it, other options tend to be at least double the price. Several startups in the field had already delayed their launches or failed to acquire ships. “But then this one popped up – they were leaving quickly, doing it for just three years and the itinerary was close to perfect,” says Florida-based Shay. “I jumped on it.” Within 12 hours of reading about Life at Sea, she’d booked a cabin. She wasn’t the only one to move fast. Also in Florida, Jenny Phenix had been looking into the idea for several years. “When they described a residential cruise at a price I could actually afford, that was a no-brainer for me,” she says. “My entire working life, I was planning on traveling as much of the world as possible once I retired. It’d all depend on what I could afford, and I thought I’d be doing it in little chunks, as much as I could fit in before the end of my life. No other cruise was even close to affordable for me, so when I saw that, it was a game changer. I didn’t even hesitate for a second.” As for Fox, once he paid his deposit, he decided not to share his plans with anyone. “I guess I always had a feeling inside that it might not happen,” he says. “I never told anyone, because I didn’t want to make a big deal about it and then tell everyone it fell apart.” To begin with, everything was plain sailing, but then the plans hit rougher waters. As managing director of Life at Sea, Mikael Petterson had been overseeing sales. Petterson says the idea for Life at Sea was originally his, conjured up while working as a cruise start-up consultant. “I’ve worked with some of our competitors, and they all shoot for the moon – million-dollar residences; it’s never affordable,” he says. His idea, he says, was to get a slightly older ship, with slightly smaller cabins, and make it “affordable for the everyday person.” A shipbroker paired him up with Miray which, unlike other residential cruise start-ups, already had a boat: the MV Gemini, a 19,000-ton vessel built in 1992, with a capacity of 1,074 passengers. Petterson was hired to manage sales. By the end of March 2023, just one month after sales opened, Petterson says his team had sold 285 out of 400 cabins. Miray disputes this, claiming that after Petterson’s departure, it found “around 130 cabins” booked, 30 of which later canceled. In April, says Petterson, they got bad news. On a visit to the MV Gemini, his team was told by engineers that the ship wasn’t up to scratch for the planned journey. Miray disputes this, although in a March email Ethem Bayramoğlu, Miray’s then vice president of marine operations and ground services, called a proposed nonstop transatlantic crossing in the Gemini “very risky” because of limited fuel capacity. “Vedat said, ‘Oh, don’t worry about it. We’re going to get you a new ship,’ ” says Petterson, referring to Vedat Ugurlu, Miray’s owner. Passengers knew nothing of the speedbump. As they pored over pictures of the MV Gemini, the Life at Sea team traveled to Germany to visit the Aura, a larger, 42-ton ship with a capacity of more than 1,200, that was soon to be retired by Carnival subsidiary AIDA Cruises. They decided to buy. Petterson says that as a May 30, 2023, customer payment deadline approached, he still hadn’t received confirmation that a suitable ship had been acquired for the cruise – so without consulting Miray, he postponed the payment deadline by a month. When Miray objected, he resigned, along with much of his team, and told passengers the cruise was off. In response, Kendra Holmes – who was promoted from vice president of strategy and business development to CEO – told passengers on Facebook that around half the founding team had left, but that Miray was determined to make the cruise go ahead. Things turned nasty. Petterson – who says his team was never paid commission for sales made – told clients the cruise was off and criticized Miray on social media. Miray promptly brought a defamation lawsuit against him, although the company dismissed it in December 2023 after the cruise had been canceled. Petterson has now launched a rival project, Villa Vie Residences. Meanwhile, a lawsuit against Life at Sea from four members of the original sales team demanding nearly $600,000 in damages is underway. Bayramoğlu, now chief operating officer of Miray, calls it “ridiculous.” He has shown CNN an invoice from Petterson, demanding $1.7 million in commission – what they’d be owed if everyone had paid in full – dated May 10, 2023, when only deposits had been taken. “How can we pay $1.7 million if we have collected only $500,000 as deposit?” Bayramoğlu asks. The schism within the cruise team rattled some passengers. Miray offered full refunds to anyone who wanted to cancel. Sharon Lane took her money and ran. “The risk was too great,” she told CNN at the time. Looking back now, she’s relieved: “I lost large sums of money twice in my life by trusting people to do what they promised. I did not want to risk a third financial disaster.” But many stayed. “There’s no trepidation at all,” Shay told CNN at the time. “I’m over-the-moon excited to just drop out and drop into a new life.” Others who stayed had reservations. “I had to ask myself, ‘Is it a scam?’ ” says Fox of the new team. “I decided no, it can’t be.” Holmes, the CEO, called him personally to go through plans. “After I talked to her, I was persuaded it was legit, even if I wasn’t convinced they’d succeed,” he says. “I told her, ‘If it’s a scam, you deserve to keep my money.’ ” With Petterson and his team gone, plans for the cruise continued apace. Miray promised passengers a bigger, better ship – the Aura. It said it would complete the purchase in late September 2023. In early summer, diver Noel Hansen met for coffee with his old friend Kendra Holmes. Miray’s new CEO was also a qualified diving instructor who had previously worked for Hansen, who owns The Dive Place in Clermont, Florida. “We’ve known Kendra for years, and we were chatting in the store. It started out as a light conversation about ‘Wouldn’t it be fun to go diving around the world?’ ” he says. “It progressed to the point where she came back and said, ‘I want to do a dive-round-the-world program, and I’d like you guys to do it.’ ” Hansen and his team got to work. “We spent weeks going through the itinerary, setting up contacts for dive opportunities in the ports of call. Then, because we were going to be putting two staff members on the ship, we hired another instructor in September.” No one outside Life at Sea and Miray knows exactly how many people signed up for the cruise. In July, Holmes suggested to CNN that around 200 cabins had been sold, with new bookings for the Aura evening out the cancelations from the Petterson split. Now, she estimates they had about 150. When the cruise was canceled in November, Bayramoğlu told passengers that only 111 cabins were booked. Some people had lucky escapes thanks to Miray’s own staff. Bonnie Kelter, from New Jersey, had read about the cruise when it was first announced, but boarding it had seemed like pie-in-the-sky. Then, in August, her husband announced he wanted a divorce. “I said, ‘Well I don’t have grandchildren, I don’t have a husband – the anchor had been cut off my neck,’ ” she says. “My ex was like, ‘You’re crazy.’ In my mind I was on the ship already.” The staffing and medical care appealed to her as a newly single retiree, as did the community that the passengers were building on social media. Kelter immediately put her house up for sale and called Life at Sea, asking if she could put down a third of the money they wanted – it was all she could afford until her house sold. “She said she had to go to upper management, and I never heard back. When I read on CNN about the delays, I thought, ‘Well, I won’t press her,’ ” she remembers. But she trusted Miray’s sales representative: “She had a good answer for everything. If she was lying, she was really good.” Kelter’s plan was to put down her deposit as soon as her house sale went through. Luckily for her, it sold on December 1, two weeks after the trip was canceled. She didn’t lose money, but she no longer has a home. She is now living in an extended-stay property, working out her next move. Kelter wasn’t the only person to sell her house to go on the cruise. “I liquidated everything I owned in preparation for that trip – I was in hook, line and sinker,” says Rebecca Varner. Varner had spent 30 years traveling the globe for the US Foreign Service, but 18 years earlier she had settled in Maine. She loved her community there, but reading about the cruise, she’d felt a pull. Regular cruises, where you dip into port for a day, had never appealed to her, but a cruise where you spend around a week in each port, as Life at Sea was promising? “This was going to take me to cultures I could explore,” she says. She put her house on the market in April, then sold her car and possessions that she’d collected from all over the world. In October, she moved in with her sister in Florida to await the departure. Life at Sea had told passengers that it would officially buy AIDA’s Aura by late September 2023 and rechristen it as the MV Lara, with dry dock renovations starting soon after. But as the clock ticked into October, several passengers got worried: the company had stopped responding to messages. Holmes told CNN on October 6 that the sale would close the following week. She said the cruise was “not delayed” and that whispers that the sale had not completed were “merely a rumor.” She added that passengers were “not concerned.” In fact, Holmes says now, she flew to Germany in late September to complete the purchase of the Aura, and boarded the ship with her team, as well as crew that Miray had hired. But while she was in a meeting onboard with Carnival to sign for the ship, she got a call from Miray owner Ugurlu. “He basically told me, ‘The money didn’t come through. We’re working on it. We need another week.’ So then I had to tell Carnival, ‘We didn’t get the money.’ It was the most humiliating position I’ve ever been put in in my entire life.” She says the ship was sold to another company as Miray looked, unsuccessfully, for other investors. Miray then set its sights on buying Aura’s sister ship, the AIDAvita, which was also on sale. That way, they could reuse the customized interiors they’d had made for Aura. But without investment, it was impossible. Passengers knew nothing of this but realized there was a problem when Miray went silent. Speaking anonymously at the time, Phenix warned, “I’m completely homeless and jobless come November 1.” Her fears came true. Ahead of the cruise, she closed her two companies and rented out her condo. She says she couldn’t now afford the mortgage even if she evicted her tenant, which she wouldn’t do. Her fellow would-be passenger George Fox says: “I started to doubt whether it was going to happen. It didn’t seem like they were anywhere near getting enough people.” He decided not to send his next payment. “I was already out $70,000,” he says. “I was still hoping it would happen, but I had a gut feeling.” He wasn’t the only one. Noel Hansen had lined up a vendor to supply diving equipment to the ship, but they needed a month’s lead time. “When the communications stopped dropping to the residents, that’s when we went, ‘Wait a minute.’ ” He told the vendor to hold fast. Throughout October, more and more passengers spoke with CNN about their fears that the cruise might not happen. The company was adamant that it would. On October 24, Miray’s PR spokesperson told CNN that the departure date had been moved to November 30. On November 13, with still no ship on the horizon, the same PR rep said that Holmes had resigned as CEO. Holmes appeared to confirm the news via text to CNN. Yet four days later it was Holmes who would tell passengers that the cruise was off. At the time, she told CNN that she had resigned, but that her relationship with Miray was “complicated.” CNN broke the news that the cruise was canceled on November 24. “It was the same as when my parents said they were getting divorced,” says Fox. “I was like, well, doh! I knew it was coming.” Passengers had boxed up their possessions into “pods” to be loaded onto the ship. The pods were in a Miami warehouse. After waiting in vain for Miray to return their belongings, Varner and another passenger, Lorna Bolduc, paid for delivery themselves. Bolduc was watching the fallout from Florida where she was renting. She says she paid around $200,000 for an external cabin – upfront, in full, to take advantage of an early bird discount. “I wasn’t embarrassed it was canceled,” she says. “What’s embarrassing is that people ask, ‘Are you getting your money back and I said ‘Yeah, it’s coming end of December.’ Then in January they asked, ‘Did you get your first instalment?’ ” Because although Miray vowed to refund all passengers in three monthly tranches, starting in December, few have received any money so far, according to passengers, one of whom is missing $325,000. Miray’s Bayramoğlu now promises that all passengers will be refunded in full by February 15, the original date for the completion of the reimbursements, in either one or two transactions. He says they will also repay expenses incurred including travel to Europe and the rerouting of passenger pods. He blames the repayment issues on passengers disputing the transactions through their banks. “The banks have frozen our funds to secure the payback and will refund the money by itself,” he says. “Our bank here wants to make sure that all chargebacks are paid in full. We now have an agreement with the banks and the refunds will be made very soon.” Meanwhile, the passengers are in limbo. Some are traveling together: Bolduc and Varner have “dropped off the map” to Costa Rica for three months, and Phenix is renting on the beach in Ecuador along with two other passengers. Phenix is one of the 78 disillusioned passengers who signed a letter to the US attorney of Southern Florida asking him to investigate fraud claims on January 16. “I don’t believe it started out to be anything fraudulent, but I absolutely believe when they realized the Gemini wouldn’t be able to make the trip and then started giving us a lot of incorrect information or withholding important information – at that point it became fraud,” she says. Bayramoğlu says the company “protests” the accusation “because we will pay everything back. Miray Cruises is for real and spent more than 33 years in the cruise industry.” He added: “Now, we are concentrated on making the refunds, to declare the new vessel for 2024 Life at Sea departure and to continue our Aegean Islands operations with Gemini.” Miray has offered the would-be passengers a free Mediterranean cruise this summer, and it has promised to actually launch a Life at Sea cruise in November. Bolduc and Varner, who are feeling sanguine, would consider it “if it were to take place – but I don’t think it will after this,” says Varner, who’s waiting until spring to decide what to do next. George Fox, whose bank had flagged his initial payment, doesn’t think it was a scam. “It just fell apart. And the man with the money will either make good or he won’t, simple as that.” Hansen, the dive shop owner, has a similar theory. “I don’t think there was an outright intention to defraud or mislead, I personally think they just weren’t sure how to handle it and it was getting out of control,” he says. “I think it was a spiraling staircase going down to the depths of hell. Once the spiral started it kept on going.”",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/how-the-three-year-cruise-fell-apart/index.html,"april two thousand and twenty-three george fox gearing adventure lifetime

53,"Loss, pain, harm: Grieving parents set the tone at this week’s tech CEOs hearing. It could change things","Facebook turns 20 years old today, and if you don’t like it, I’m sure you have your reasons. The numerous scandals. The loss of privacy. The time it drains away from other, better activities. And on and on. But I’ve been thinking about the role Facebook has played in my life, and I’ve come to a realization. I hesitate to share this status update, this decidedly uncool confession, but I’m going to, eventually. Just let me work up to it. Last Friday I found myself scrolling down toward the beginning of my timeline. It took a long time to get there, even though I joined the party relatively late. On September 23, 2007, a friend wrote on my wall, “Welcome to Facebook. Finally.” By then some of the youngsters had already left, but it all felt new and exciting to me. I was 27, and I remember the strange thrill of tagging your friends in a picture. Or better yet, being tagged. There was a lot of work involved, with the digital camera and the unwieldy cable and the uploading and whatnot, but eventually I posted the pictures from that one epic Halloween party. I dressed as Jonathan the YouTube Zombie, which confused some of my early Facebook friends. “I like turtles,” I wrote, by way of explanation. As hundreds of millions of others joined, Facebook began to change the world, for better and worse. My future boss wrote a viral story titled “The 12 most annoying Facebookers.” I was probably several of them at one time or another: mysteriously “waiting for a sign,” or “pondering the meaning of Donnie Darko,” or shamelessly promoting the stories I’d written. But my list of friends grew. In 2009, roughly 40 of them wrote on my wall to wish me happy birthday. About the same number congratulated me later that year, when I told Facebook I was going to be a dad. Now the posts shifted away from concerts and parties, and toward the ramblings of the domesticated. I loaded the dishwasher twice in one evening. I wandered the grocery store, “too hungry and confused to know what to buy.” My daughter was born, and one afternoon I somehow changed two diapers in the span of two minutes. That year, 2010, more than 50 people wished me happy birthday. This, it turned out, was Peak Happy Birthday. Such greetings became less common on Facebook after that, at least for me. Maybe the novelty wore off. We were all tired of something. On September 23, 2011, I wrote this status update: Groggy wife, referring to my persistent alarm clock: “I’ll throw it in the river. I don’t know what river, but I’ll find one.” Another child was born. My children began talking, which led to my new favorite genre of Facebook post: Cute Thing My Kid Said. My daughter strung together her first five-word sentence. “I need more too, Mama.” She was talking about a doughnut. Other random kids said cute things, too, and these also became Facebook posts. At the park, a seven-year-old girl started talking to me about my daughter. “What kind of girl will she be?” this outgoing youngster asked me. “Sports? Lazy? I’m sports. Fashionable? Playing girl, which not sports? Running girl? There are different types of girls.” The next year only six people wrote on my timeline for my birthday. One was my wife’s sister, Jill: Happy Birthday, Bro-in-Law! Hope it’s GREAT! :) Another son was born. I memorialized his arrival in a Facebook post but did not say he was fighting for his life in intensive care. He got well and came home, but 2015 was still a hard year. One day I posted some Bruce Springsteen lyrics: Everything dies Baby, that’s a fact But maybe everything that dies Someday comes back I posted this mysterious status update, firmly in the role of the annoying Facebooker known as The Obscurist, but I was too ashamed to tell the story behind it: I’d just lost my job at Sports Illustrated, and my confidence was so shaken that I didn’t know if I’d be able to write again. Eventually I landed at CNN, following the presidential campaign. In 2016, as we planned a family trip to Disney World, Jill was one of a handful of people who wrote on my wall: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BRO-IN-LAW!!!!!! I shall buy you a Mickey ice cream bar soon!!!!!! :) A decade into the Facebook experiment, I was posting less and less. Memories began popping up automatically, old pictures from years past, and I resurfaced them with new comments and new hearts. In 2019 only one person wrote on my timeline for my birthday. I heard a song by the Goo Goo Dolls in the grocery store, which led to a rare status update: what if you wrote a song that said “a tired song keeps playing on a tired radio” and then 25 years later your song became the tired song that keeps playing on the tired radio The coronavirus pandemic brought an upsurge in Facebook activity as we huddled in our homes and wondered what was happening out there. We sent out encouragement to the brave healthcare workers and paid tribute to departed musicians with virtual concerts on Facebook Live. That July I had my 40th birthday. Jill did not write on my wall. She had died two days earlier, at age 39, after an illness that led to a pulmonary embolism. As I write this in early February, I have yet to post anything on Facebook in 2024. I don’t know why, exactly. Too busy, perhaps, or too lazy. But this is my confession about Facebook: If given the chance, I would join all over again. Yes, I am grateful for Facebook. I’ve never consistently kept a journal, so Facebook is one of the closest things I have to a contemporaneous record of my life. And in some ways it’s better than a journal, because it has pictures and videos and annotations from my friends. At its best, Facebook is a digital museum, a repository for the milestones of life. It has made party invitations a lot easier — and helped me find some good Ultimate Frisbee games. It has connected me with old friends and classmates and relatives who otherwise might have remained disconnected. It has helped preserve my memories of several very dear people who, like Jill, have since passed away. Facebook friendship is no substitute for real-life friendship, and someone else’s Facebook pictures are no substitute for your own experience. But at times, Facebook has helped me appreciate real life more deeply. On November 9, 2021, as new coronavirus variants forced us back into isolation, I asked my friends, “What’s a small thing that makes you happy?’” The post got 85 comments. People gave thanks for cozy blankets and a fire, hideous fuzzy socks, the smell of leather boots, an empty dishwasher, a cup of hot chocolate, a cold beer after a good run, autumn leaves at golden hour, reading books in the evening before bed. “The excited way my dog looks at me in the morning,” my neighbor Cheryl wrote. “‘Oh boy! We get to do this all over again?” It was an outpouring of gratitude, a celebration of life. Online, yes, but real, and satisfying. Like an orange sunrise. A frosted windowpane. A silent alarm clock on a Sunday morning.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/world/facebook-family-friends-connections-essay-cec/index.html,facebook turn twenty year old today ’ like ’ sure reason

54,An affordability crisis is making some young Americans give up on ever owning a home,"A spur-of-the-minute detour led to a “real great adventure” for a Parisian visitor to the United States. Julien Navas, who was visiting the US from France to see the launch of the first US moon landing mission in decades from Cape Canaveral, Florida, also ventured to New Orleans. Along the way, learned about the Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, according to a news release from Arkansas State Parks. Having panned for gold and searched for ammonite fossils before, and the park caught his interest. On January 11, Navas arrived at the park, bought his ticket, and rented a basic diamond hunting kit, according to the news release. “I got to the park around nine o’clock and started to dig,” Navas said in the release. “That is back-breaking work, so by the afternoon I was mainly looking on top of the ground for anything that stood out.” Lucky for Navas, the park had received more than an inch of rain a few days before he arrived, so it was wet and muddy, the release said. “As rain falls on the field, it washes away the dirt and uncovers heavy rocks, minerals and diamonds near the surface,” Assistant Park Superintendent Waymon Cox explained. Many of the park’s biggest diamonds are found on the surface, Cox said, and the park periodically plows the 37.5 acre search area to loosen the soil and to promote natural erosion. Eventually, Navas emerged at the park’s Diamond Discovery Center with his findings. There, he was told he had found a 7.46-carat brown diamond. Navas said he was stunned, according to the release, and said all he could think about was telling his fiancé what he had found. The stone is deep chocolate brown and rounded like a marble, according to the release, and is about the size of a candy gumdrop. Navas named his diamond the Carine Diamond, after his fiancé, and plans to have the stone divided into two diamonds, one to gift to his bride-to-be and the other for his daughter. The Carine Diamond is the eighth-largest diamond found in the Crater of Diamonds since it became a state park in 1972, according to the news release. On average, park visitors find one or two diamonds there every day. The diamonds formed hundreds of millions of years ago, some 60 to 100 miles underground. Geologists explained about 100 million years ago, there was a volcanic eruption, which carried the diamonds to the surface, according to the park’s website. Navas called the park a “magical place, where the dream of finding a diamond can come true! It was a real great adventure.” Navas said he hopes to come back to the park with his daughter when she is older.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/27/travel/arkansas-diamond-state-park-trnd/index.html,"spuroftheminute detour led “ real great adventure ” parisian visitor united state julien navas visiting u france see launch first u moon landing mission decade cape canaveral florida also ventured new orleans along way learned crater diamond state park arkansas according news release arkansas state park panned gold searched ammonite fossil park caught interest january eleven navas arrived park bought ticket rented basic diamond hunting kit according news release “ got park around nine ’ clock started dig ” navas said release “ backbreaking work afternoon mainly looking top ground anything stood ” lucky navas park received inch rain day arrived wet muddy release said “ rain fall field wash away dirt uncovers heavy rock mineral diamond near surface ” assistant park superintendent waymon cox explained many park ’ biggest diamond found surface cox said park periodically plow three hundred and seventy-five acre search area loosen soil promote natural erosion eventually navas emerged park ’ diamond discovery center finding told found 746carat brown diamond navas said stunned according release said could think telling fiancé found stone deep chocolate brown rounded like marble according release size candy gumdrop navas named diamond carine diamond fiancé plan stone divided two diamond one gift bridetobe daughter carine diamond eighthlargest diamond found crater diamond since became state park one thousand, nine hundred and seventy-two according news release average park visitor find one two diamond every day diamond formed hundred million year ago sixty one hundred mile underground geologist explained one hundred million year ago volcanic eruption carried diamond surface according park ’ website navas called park “ magical place dream finding diamond come true real great adventure ” navas said hope come back park daughter older",2
55,Target pulls Black history item that misidentified Civil Rights leaders,"The US destroyed or damaged 84 out of 85 targets in its sweeping series of airstrikes on Friday in Syria and Iraq, according to two US defense officials, with no indications of Iranian casualties. All but one of the 85 targets were “destroyed or functionally damaged,” the officials said, citing a preliminary battlefield damage assessment. A complete post-strike analysis is still underway, but one official said there are no indications that members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed as part of the operations. President Joe Biden told reporters traveling with him to Nevada Sunday that the strikes are working to deter and disrupt militant groups’ operations in the region. In response to a drone attack that killed three US service members and wounded scores more in Jordan last weekend, the US targeted facilities and weapons used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria. It marked the first time the US has carried out strikes in both countries simultaneously. In Iraq, the US targeted al-Qaim and Akashat near the border with Syria. And in Syria, the US struck near al-Barum, Deir ez-Zur and al-Mayadin.  The target list included command and control centers, intelligence centers, rockets, missile, drone storage facilities and more. On Friday, in a briefing with reporters after the strikes, Lt. Gen. Douglas Sims, the director of the Joint Staff, said the targets were chosen “with an idea that there would likely be casualties associated with people inside those facilities.” The Biden administration has faced criticism that it waited too long to respond to the deadly drone strike in Jordan, which gave the Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria time to move their personnel. Sims said on Friday that good weather conditions for the operation weren’t present until Friday night. Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes, far larger than previous US operations in Iraq or Syria, were only the start of the US response. National security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” earlier Sunday that the US retaliation for the strike that killed three US service members was not over. Sullivan called the Friday strikes the “beginning of our response and there will be more steps to come.” Since the US strikes, there has been one attack on Saturday against US forces at Mission Support Site Euphrates, also known as the Conoco oil fields, according to one of the defense officials. The attack consisted of two rockets launched against the site, with no injuries or damage reported.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/politics/us-damage-assessment-syria-iraq/index.html,u destroyed damaged eighty-four eighty-five target sweeping series airstrikes friday syria iraq according two u defense official indication iranian casualty one eighty-five target “ destroyed functionally damaged ” official said citing preliminary battlefield damage assessment complete poststrike analysis still underway one official said indication member iran ’ islamic revolutionary guard corp killed part operation president joe biden told reporter traveling nevada sunday strike working deter disrupt militant group ’ operation region response drone attack killed three u service member wounded score jordan last weekend u targeted facility weapon used iran ’ islamic revolutionary guard corp iranbacked militia iraq syria marked first time u carried strike country simultaneously iraq u targeted alqaim akashat near border syria syria u struck near albarum deir ezzur almayadin target list included command control center intelligence center rocket missile drone storage facility friday briefing reporter strike lt gen douglas sims director joint staff said target chosen “ idea would likely casualty associated people inside facility ” biden administration faced criticism waited long respond deadly drone strike jordan gave iranbacked militia iraq syria time move personnel sims said friday good weather condition operation ’ present friday night biden defense secretary lloyd austin said strike far larger previous u operation iraq syria start u response national security adviser jake sullivan told cnn ’ dana bash “ state union ” earlier sunday u retaliation strike killed three u service member sullivan called friday strike “ beginning response step come ” since u strike one attack saturday u force mission support site euphrates also known conoco oil field according one defense official attack consisted two rocket launched site injury damage reported,7
56,Restroom management will be a science at this year’s Super Bowl,"At least 28 have been killed in an attack on a building in the town of Lysychansk in the Russian-occupied region of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, the region’s Moscow-installed head said Sunday. In a statement on Telegram, the head of self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic Leonid Pasechnik said emergency services had rescued 10 people from under the rubble after what he said was a Ukrainian attack on a building housing a bakery on Saturday. Pasechnik said Sunday has been declared a day of mourning in the Luhansk People’s Republic for the victims of the attack. Ukraine’s defense ministry has not commented on the incident. Lysychansk was taken over by Russian forces in July 2022, becoming the last town in the key region of Luhansk in eastern Ukraine to fall. Ukraine has been escalating its attacks on Russia and Russian-controlled territory as its ground offensive stalls. Earlier this week, Ukraine’s military intelligence says it sank a Russian warship off the coast of Crimea, landing the latest in a series of blows to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Last month, the Russian Defense Ministry said it stopped Ukrainian drones headed toward Moscow and St Petersburg. Also in January, an oil depot was set ablaze as a result of a Ukrainian drone strike in Russia’s Bryansk region, bordering Ukraine, according to authorities. In December, Ukraine launched an attack on the Russian border city of Belgorod, killing at least 24 and wounding 108 others. Russia responded with retaliatory strikes on Kharkiv. It comes as Russian forces are working hard to break through Ukraine’s defenses on the battlefield. A member of the Ukrainian army said they are in “deep defense mode.” Russian troops are aiming to advance towards Chasiv Yar, a highly militarized town on higher ground a few kilometers west of Bakhmut. Further south, Russian attention has been focused for months on the town of Avdiivka, and its massive coke plant, both of which Russia has been attempting to encircle.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/europe/lysychansk-strike-russia-ukraine-intl/index.html,least twenty-eight killed attack building town lysychansk russianoccupied region luhansk eastern ukraine region ’ moscowinstalled head said sunday statement telegram head selfproclaimed luhansk people ’ republic leonid pasechnik said emergency service rescued ten people rubble said ukrainian attack building housing bakery saturday pasechnik said sunday declared day mourning luhansk people ’ republic victim attack ukraine ’ defense ministry commented incident lysychansk taken russian force july two thousand and twenty-two becoming last town key region luhansk eastern ukraine fall ukraine escalating attack russia russiancontrolled territory ground offensive stall earlier week ukraine ’ military intelligence say sank russian warship coast crimea landing latest series blow russia ’ black sea fleet last month russian defense ministry said stopped ukrainian drone headed toward moscow st petersburg also january oil depot set ablaze result ukrainian drone strike russia ’ bryansk region bordering ukraine according authority december ukraine launched attack russian border city belgorod killing least twenty-four wounding one hundred and eight others russia responded retaliatory strike kharkiv come russian force working hard break ukraine ’ defense battlefield member ukrainian army said “ deep defense mode ” russian troop aiming advance towards chasiv yar highly militarized town higher ground kilometer west bakhmut south russian attention focused month town avdiivka massive coke plant russia attempting encircle,7
57,More and more travelers are visiting every country in the world. Some are having second thoughts about it,"All Dani Jo Carter heard was a bang. It was September 25, 2016, but it still felt like a warm, summer night. Stopped at a red light in the heart of downtown Atlanta, Carter gripped the steering wheel of the white Ford Expedition and looked to her right, where Diane McIver, a well-known business executive and her best friend of more than 30 years, sat in shock. Behind Diane sat her husband, Claud Lee “Tex” McIver, an attorney with powerful political connections, with a gun in his lap. “Tex, you shot me,” Diane muttered, slumping forward. Hours later, she was pronounced dead at an Atlanta hospital. Her husband was charged in the killing, and his 2018 criminal trial, which spanned more than a month and featured dozens of witnesses, led to his felony murder conviction. Jurors found McIver guilty of intentionally shooting his wife, and he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life behind bars. But now, nearly six years since that trial, McIver, 81, may soon walk out of prison after a plea deal that could mark the end of a tragic and convoluted case of wealth, power and controversy that captured global headlines. In 2022, the Georgia Supreme Court threw out the guilty verdict against McIver, ruling jurors should have been allowed to consider a lesser charge. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced she would retry McIver for felony murder, setting the stage for a second trial in December 2023. But the new trial was halted indefinitely as soon as jury selection began over evidence issues. And last Friday, with the second trial never making it any further, McIver took a negotiated deal and pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of felony involuntary manslaughter, admitting he acted recklessly with the gun but did not intentionally shoot his wife. “This resolution that the lawyers on both sides have reached is one that will allow the greatest number of people to move forward as best they can,” Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney said last Friday. McIver’s negotiated sentence – including eight years in prison – is largely offset by the roughly 6.5 years he’s already spent behind bars, his attorney Don Samuel told CNN, adding he could be released on parole any day – if the parole board approves. Once he is released, McIver will be on probation at home, with a strict curfew and ankle monitor, according to the plea agreement. On that night in 2016, Carter and the McIvers were on their way back to Atlanta after a weekend at their sprawling ranch about an hour away in Putnam County, where they had horses, a guest house and a saloon-style entertainment area among other amenities. Carter and Diane chatted for most of the drive after the group stopped for dinner. In the back seat, Tex appeared to nod off. CNN gathered details of Diane’s last night from witness testimony during McIver’s 2018 murder trial and from the June 2022 state Supreme Court ruling that reversed his conviction. For a Sunday evening, traffic was heavy on the interstate. A string of red brake lights stretching far into the distance welcomed them to the city. At the urging of her friend, Dani Jo Carter took an early exit off the highway, to return to the McIvers’ lavish Buckhead condo through the downtown streets. “This is a really bad area,” McIver complained from the backseat as they exited the highway, saying they were in a bad part of town. He would later tell investigators the area was dark and had a “particularly high population” of homeless people. McIver asked his wife for his gun, and she reached into the SUV’s center console and handed back a .38 caliber revolver inside a Publix bag. Soon, they reached a stoplight. The conversation stopped. Carter heard Diane locking the car doors as they waited. Then, came the bang. Prosecutors in the 2018 trial argued McIver had intentionally killed his wife for her money. Diane was described by those who knew her as a good friend and a brilliant businesswoman. She rose from a bookkeeper to the president of a real estate business and owned, or partly owned, at least three other companies. Tex was a partner at a large law firm with offices across the US and sat on the state’s election board, which oversees voting and election procedures. When the pair got married, they kept their finances separate, prosecutor Seleta Griffin had told jurors. Tex McIver’s life had begun “spinning out of control” before Diane’s death, Griffin said. His salary saw a steep decline as he prepared to retire and he borrowed large sums of money from Diane to try and keep up with his affluent lifestyle, including a $350,000 loan that would allow her to foreclose on the couple’s ranch if he couldn’t pay on time. Who would get that ranch after the couple died was a point of contention, prosecutors said. McIver wanted to leave it to a son from a previous marriage, while Diane wanted it to go to their godson. In the months after Diane’s death, McIver auctioned off her expensive belongings – a quick sale prosecutors argued showed he was focused on money. McIver said he was advised by an attorney to sell his late wife’s things to fulfill her will’s responsibilities. “He sold her hats, shoes, purses, her fur coats. Why?” lead prosecutor Clint Rucker said in 2018 closing statements, arguing obligations in her will still were not fulfilled after those sales. “He didn’t care about Diane McIver; he just wanted her money.” The state also argued McIver’s comments and actions after his wife’s death suggested he was dishonest and lacked remorse. An emergency room nurse told the court she heard him say he shot Diane while cleaning the gun in his bathroom. (Defense attorneys pointed out no other nurses heard McIver make that comment.) A man who had worked for Diane testified McIver told him they had been in a car accident and his wife was killed. Another witness also testified that about a month after Diane’s death, McIver spoke about a woman he had dated and said maybe he could “get her back.” Prosecutors also argued McIver had a financial motive by saying his net worth shot up when Diane died, and after her death, he became the executor and one of the beneficiaries of her multimillion-dollar estate. “On September 25, 2016, Diane was making all of the money. Diane owned the two condos in Buckhead. Diane could take the ranch – this ranch, according to the witnesses, that was his pride and joy,” Griffin said in the trial. “The easiest way for him to gain control was to kill Diane.” But the defense argued that because McIver served as the executor of his wife’s estate, he did not have control of her money, but had to fulfill bequests in her will and pay off other obligations, including funeral expenses. And, the defense said, Diane’s death cut off a regular cash flow McIver received from her. “There is no doubt that Tex McIver depended on his wife’s money,” defense attorney Bruce Harvey said in trial. “It would have been financially detrimental to him to concoct a plan to deliberately take the life of his wife.” Defense attorneys argued the shooting was a horrible accident and the gun was accidentally fired when McIver, who they said suffered from a sleeping disorder, was startled. And, the defense said, killing Diane on that drive just didn’t make sense – a point also made by the state’s highest court. “If McIver intended to fatally shoot Diane, why would he do it in the presence of Carter, and why would he do it in midtown Atlanta, within a few miles of several major hospitals, instead of on a rural interstate, far from any medical aid?” the state’s supreme court ruling said. Jurors found McIver guilty of felony murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. They acquitted him of malice murder, finding while he did not intentionally kill his wife, he did purposefully shoot her. He was also convicted on one count of influencing a witness, stemming from a comment McIver made to Dani Jo Carter on the night of Diane’s death, instructing her to tell authorities she was not in the SUV at the time of the shooting. He has already served the five-year sentence for that count and the state’s supreme court did not overturn that conviction. McIver appealed his murder conviction, arguing there was enough evidence presented at trial for the judge to have allowed jurors the option to consider a lesser charge of misdemeanor involuntary manslaughter – which carries a much lighter sentence. The state’s supreme court agreed with him. “The jury could have concluded that the revolver was not deliberately or intentionally fired, but rather, as McIver suggests, discharged as a result of his being startled awake, reflexively or involuntarily clutching at the bag holding the firearm, and inadvertently contacting the trigger,” the court ruled. And, it said, the evidence prosecutors presented that the shooting was intentional was “not overwhelming or even strong,” and that witnesses said the couple was “very much in love” and no one testified about any quarrels between them. The court also ruled that evidence of a new will Diane had allegedly created before her death was “irrelevant and inadmissible.” Prosecutors had attempted to use Diane’s alleged new will to prove McIver had a financial motive to kill her. Diane’s original will was executed in 2006 – before the McIvers’ godson was born – and included “substantial bequests to (Tex) McIver and established a trust for his benefit,” the supreme court’s ruling said. But a coworker and friend of Diane testified that a year and a half before her death, Diane entrusted her with making copies of a “new will.” The court also heard testimony Diane had prepared a codicil – a document modifying a person’s will – which added their godson as a beneficiary, but that codicil was never executed. Prosecutors could not prove a new will existed, and the state supreme court ruled there was no proof McIver knew about it or its contents – nor that there was evidence the alleged new will would give him a reason to want to kill Diane. Less than a month after the court’s ruling was published, the district attorney’s office said it would retry McIver on felony murder and the aggravated assault and firearm possession charges, highlighting jurors previously “unanimously convicted (McIver) of intentional crimes of violence against his wife.” Instead, prosecutors allowed him last month to plead guilty to unintentionally causing his wife’s death. He was sentenced to 15 years: eight in prison and seven on probation, with the first five probation years served under home confinement with a curfew and an ankle monitor, according to the plea agreement. The time he’s already served behind bars will be counted toward his eight-year prison term. “The resolution reached allows those who loved, cared, and admired Diane McIver to close this chapter and move forward the best they can by honoring the memory of Mrs. McIver who was full of life and touched and changed the lives of many with her larger than life personality and vigor,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Adam Abbate said in a statement emailed to CNN. McIver is already eligible for parole because he has served more than what is required by Georgia law for the involuntary manslaughter charge, Samuel told CNN, adding the decision is ultimately up to the parole board. Amanda Clark Palmer, another of McIver’s attorneys, said the plea “recognizes that Tex never intended to hurt Diane. He loved her deeply and still loves her today. He would never do anything to hurt her, much less intend to kill her.” In a statement before the judge on Friday, McIver apologized for the killing. “She died as a result of my actions, plain and simple.” CNN’s Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/us/tex-mciver-georgia-wife-killing/index.html,dani jo carter heard bang september twenty-five two thousand

58,What it’s like to take a road trip in Saudi Arabia,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to sell up to 50 million shares of Amazon stock over the next year, according to a regulatory filing posted on Friday. Those shares would be worth nearly $8.6 billion at the stock’s current price. Bezos’ planned stock sale was included in Amazon’s annual report published on Friday due to a Securities and Exchange Commission rule requiring such disclosures. The news also comes a day after the company reported a record holiday shopping quarter, sending shares for Amazon climbing by some 8% on Friday. Bezos, 60, stepped down as CEO of the company he founded in 2021, but he still serves as chair of the board at Amazon. Since stepping away from his daily duties at the helm of the e-commerce leader, Bezos has made headlines mostly for his colorful fashion choices, relationship with fiancé Lauren Sanchez and space-faring ambitions via his private company Blue Origin. The annual report said that Bezos adopted a trading plan to sell up to 50 million shares of Amazon stock over a period ending on January 31, 2025, subject to certain conditions. It would appear now is a good time for Bezos to sell. Amazon shares tumbled in 2022 amid a whiplash in pandemic-induced demand for e-commerce and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Current CEO Andy Jassy has since embarked on aggressive cost-cutting measures, including multiple rounds of mass layoffs that have put tens of thousands of workers out of jobs. Some of the layoffs have continued into this year. But Amazon’s stock has since rallied sharply, climbing roughly 90% since falling to $84 a share in December 2022. Moreover, Bezos’ recent move to Florida from Washington state would mean he could avoid state capital gains taxes on the stock sale. Florida currently does not have a capital gains tax. Bezos’ home state of Washington upheld a capital gains tax measure last year, according to the Seattle Times.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/tech/jeff-bezos-cash-out-billions-amazon-stock/index.html,amazon founder jeff bezos plan sell fifty million share amazon stock next year according regulatory filing posted friday share would worth nearly eighty-six billion stock ’ current price bezos ’ planned stock sale included amazon ’ annual report published friday due security exchange commission rule requiring disclosure news also come day company reported record holiday shopping quarter sending share amazon climbing eight friday bezos sixty stepped ceo company founded two thousand and twenty-one still serf chair board amazon since stepping away daily duty helm ecommerce leader bezos made headline mostly colorful fashion choice relationship fiancé lauren sanchez spacefaring ambition via private company blue origin annual report said bezos adopted trading plan sell fifty million share amazon stock period ending january thirty-one two thousand and twenty-five subject certain condition would appear good time bezos sell amazon share tumbled two thousand and twenty-two amid whiplash pandemicinduced demand ecommerce broader macroeconomic uncertainty current ceo andy jassy since embarked aggressive costcutting measure including multiple round mass layoff put ten thousand worker job layoff continued year amazon ’ stock since rallied sharply climbing roughly ninety since falling eighty-four share december two thousand and twenty-two moreover bezos ’ recent move florida washington state would mean could avoid state capital gain tax stock sale florida currently capital gain tax bezos ’ home state washington upheld capital gain tax measure last year according seattle time,9
59,Visitor finds huge 7.46-carat diamond in Crater of Diamonds State Park,"Apple has finally ended its losing streak. The company reported its first sales growth in a year on Thursday, boosted in particular by record revenue from its App Store and other services. But it’s still encountering difficulty in China. The earnings report comes one day before the company launches its biggest new product in years, the Vision Pro headset, which the company hopes to make the next must-have piece of home electronics. Overall, Apple posted its first increase in revenue in a year, but China was a weak spot: Revenue in the region slid 13% from last year. In contrast, sales increased in Europe and Japan. The company’s earnings come just one day before Apple begins selling one of its riskiest new hardware releases in recent years: An augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro. Over the past five years, Apple has spent an estimated $100 billion in research and development on the device, which will cost $3,499 in the US, according to a recent analysis. In a statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company’s growth was fueled by iPhone sales and an all-time revenue record in the company’s services division in the last three months of 2023. “We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments,” Cook said. Net iPhone sales grew from $65.7 billion one year ago to $69.7 billion in the last three months of 2023, but Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said that China’s revenue numbers indicate demand for the device in the region is slowing “more than expected in the face of rising competition from local companies, including Huawei.” “The big question is if this is just a blip, or signs of a bigger shift among consumers as rising interest rates and a weaker economic backdrop discourage consumers from making pricey purchases,” Cohen said. Cook addressed concerns about falling sales in China, saying, “I remain very optimistic about China over the long term.” Overall, Apple reported earnings per share of $2.18 for the quarter, a record for EPS for the company and higher than the $2.11 analysts had predicted. Revenue also beat analysts’ expectations for the quarter at $119.6 billion. Despite beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines, Apple’s stock dropped more than 3% after the market close. The debut of the Vision Pro dominated much of a question session with analysts and executives Thursday. “This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple,” Cook said of the Vision Pro. “It really took a whole company effort to bring it this far.” Correction: A previous version of the story misstated Apple’s past profits.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/business/apple-earnings/index.html,"apple finally ended losing streak company reported first sale growth year thursday boosted particular record revenue app store service ’ still encountering difficulty china earnings report come one day company launch biggest new product year vision pro headset company hope make next musthave piece home electronics overall apple posted first increase revenue year china weak spot revenue region slid thirteen last year contrast sale increased europe japan company ’ earnings come one day apple begin selling one riskiest new hardware release recent year augmented reality headset vision pro past five year apple spent estimated one hundred billion research development device cost three thousand, four hundred and ninety-nine u according recent analysis statement apple ceo tim cook said company ’ growth fueled iphone sale alltime revenue record company ’ service division last three month two thousand and twenty-three “ pleased announce installed base active device surpassed twenty-two billion reaching alltime high across product geographic segment ” cook said net iphone sale grew six hundred and fifty-seven billion one year ago six hundred and ninety-seven billion last three month two thousand and twenty-three jesse cohen senior analyst investingcom said china ’ revenue number indicate demand device region slowing “ expected face rising competition local company including huawei ” “ big question blip sign bigger shift among consumer rising interest rate weaker economic backdrop discourage consumer making pricey purchase ” cohen said cook addressed concern falling sale china saying “ remain optimistic china long term ” overall apple reported earnings per share two hundred and eighteen quarter record eps company higher two hundred and eleven analyst predicted revenue also beat analyst ’ expectation quarter one thousand, one hundred and ninety-six billion despite beating expectation top bottom line apple ’ stock dropped three market close debut vision pro dominated much question session analyst executive thursday “ multiple year effort many people across apple ” cook said vision pro “ really took whole company effort bring far ” correction previous version story misstated apple ’ past profit",9
60,Time Out reveals world’s best cities for 2024,"There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss. But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight. Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts. The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it. For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.” And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994. Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015. With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect. A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client. “I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN. “I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.” The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach. Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week. Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players. “I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said. “He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.” Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing. Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team. Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style. Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule. The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it. “You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying. Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.” “It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020. Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction. “I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said. “It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.” To meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal. Two 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data. The putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons. “It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed. Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse. Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto. The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas. “You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said. The deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing. Reyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract. “The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect. “There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’” Inside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop. Hospitality was a priority, with a below-ground level meaning all service, as well as golf cart storage, can be managed from underneath. Like the course, Jordan’s identity was stamped all over. Columns were set further inside below an overhanging roof to mimic the hang-time that inspired the “Air Jordan” tag, while an elephant print used on some of his shoes was incorporated into the fritted-glass roof, casting the print across the floor when the sun shines through. Customization goes all the way down to Air Jordan logos on the ice cubes, as PGA Tour pro Jimmy Walker shared to Instagram after a round at the course in March 2021. Like Weed, Reyes believes his job was made easier by an engaged client. “He was involved with a lot of the decisions … we didn’t change a color without him knowing,” Reyes said. “We have had work with other celebrity people and they won’t talk to you, it’s ‘I just want this’ and sort of like, ‘get out of the way.’ But he realized there was a lot of creativity going on and he wanted to be a part of it.” Given Jordan’s regular on-site visits, there was no big reveal for the owner when the Grove XXIII officially opened in the fall of 2019, but there was a revelation when Weed joined him for his very first round. When play finished, the architect found himself wrapped in a 6-foot, 6-inch bear hug. “He looked at me and said, ‘I’m fortunate enough I can be anywhere in the world, but there’s no other place I’d rather be than right here,’” Weed recalled. “That’s like the ultimate compliment … to have his own golf course and to shape and mold that golf course for him and his friends, it’s just where he wants to be. It’s just a great spot and evolved into something fantastic. “He’s going to enjoy it as long as he’s playing and then it’s going to get passed along to the next generation — it’s just one of the great things about golf and why it has sustained itself over centuries.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/22/sport/michael-jordan-grove-xxiii-golf-course-spt-spc-intl/index.html,"’ one small corner world

61,How the three-year cruise fell apart,"Former President Donald Trump said Sunday he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he regains the presidency. His remarks come at a time of high economic and other tensions between the US and China. “No, I would say maybe it’s going to be more than that,” Trump said when asked by Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures” whether he would consider imposing a 60% tariff, as The Washington Post has reported. As president, Trump slapped tariffs of 25% on $50 billion of Chinese goods in June 2018. Beijing countered with its own tariffs, and the spiral continued until the two countries arrived at an agreement in 2020. The Biden administration has largely kept the Trump-era tariffs in place. The former president also said he thought China would try to interfere in the 2024 presidential election. “I think they will, and they won’t be interfering on my behalf. We should go same-day voting, paper ballots, voter ID and no mail-in ballots,” Trump said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told President Joe Biden that China would not interfere in the 2024 US presidential election when the two men met in November, CNN has reported. But FBI Director Christopher Wray warned Wednesday that Chinese hackers are preparing to “wreak havoc and cause real-world harm” to the US. Trump also praised Xi, whom he described as “a very good friend of mine during my term,” and said, “I want China to do great, I do.” Trump would not say whether he would intervene if China tried taking over Taiwan, arguing that doing so would “jeopardize my negotiating ability with China.” China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and leader Xi has not ruled out the use of military force to “reunify” the island with the mainland. The US, meanwhile, is obligated under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide Taiwan with the military means to defend itself, something Beijing regards as interference in its internal affairs.

62,Wyndham Clark shoots course record 60 as he takes the lead at Pebble Beach Pro-Am,"Devastating wildfires tearing through swathes of Chile have killed more than 100 people, authorities said Sunday, as they warned that the death toll was set to rise. The Chilean National Disaster Prevention and Response Service said at least 112 people have died so far. Officials also said that 32 bodies have been identified, 38 autopsies have been conducted, and 10 bodies are ready to be delivered to relatives. News agency photographs and footage over the weekend laid bare the trail of destruction wrought in multiple communities by the infernos. Aerial shots from the El Olivar commune showed dozens of vehicles burned to shells alongside multiple houses reduced to ash. One video obtained by CNN showed the inside of a bus ferrying passengers through the city of Valparaíso as fires raged outside. There are currently 161 active fires burning across the country, the Chilean National Disaster Prevention and Response Service (SENAPRED) said. SENAPRED Director Álvaro Hormazábal told CNN affiliate CNN Chile that firefighters had controlled 102 of those fires but are still battling 40 others. Nineteen wildfires are under currently observation, Hormazábal added. President Gabriel Boric declared a state of emergency as coastal cities like Viña del Mar and Valparaiso choked in smoke. Residents living in central regions were also forced to evacuate their homes. Speaking at a press conference held after visiting affected areas on Sunday, Boric raised fears that the death toll would “increase significantly.” In a televised statement on Saturday, Boric said that the defense ministry would deploy more military units to affected areas, with all necessary resources made available. He declared Monday and Tuesday as days of national mourning for fire victims. Climate change and the El Nino weather phenomenon are driving forces behind an increasingly warm planet, scientists say, making events like heatwaves and wildfires more likely. Wildfires have intensified around the globe, providing a stark reminder of how the climate crisis is upending lives and inflicting billions of dollars a year in damage. And it will only get worse, according to experts. “Uncontrollable and devastating wildfires are becoming an expected part of the seasonal calendars in many parts of the world,” the UN Environment Programme said in a report published in 2022. ﻿The number of extreme wildfire events will increase up to 14% by 2030, according to the UN report. By 2050, the increase will climb to 30%. In Chile, the fires come as the country battles a summer heatwave. The capital Santiago has been sweltering through consecutive days of hot and dry temperatures climbing above 33 degrees Celsius (91.4°F). Neighboring Colombia battled recent wildfires, declaring a disaster and also calling for international help to fight the flames. Emergency crews on the ground in Chile are prioritizing the fires in the port city of Valparaíso because of its proximity to urban areas. Local officials said 372 residents were reported missing. Located about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northwest of the capital Santiago on Chile’s coast, Valparaiso is a popular tourist destination known for its colorful houses, idyllic hills and its historic old town. Valeria Melipillán, mayor of Quilpué city, the capital of the Marga Marga Province in central Chile’s Valparaíso Region, told CNN Chile that the wildfires are “probably the largest ever” in the region. Nearly 1,400 houses in the municipality have been damaged, Melipillán added. Chile’s Finance Minister Mario Marcel told reporters on Sunday that preliminary estimates for damages in the Valaparaíso region was expected to reach “hundreds of millions of dollars.” While evacuation efforts had been efficient, some living in affected areas did not want to vacate their homes, local search and rescue officials said. Rodrigo Mundaca, the governor of Valparaiso, said curfews were in place in the towns of Viña del Mar, Quilpué, Villa Alemana and Limache to allow authorities to focus on battling the blazes. Pope Francis, who hails from nearby Argentina, called upon people to “pray for the deceased and injured victims of the devastating fires that have affected central Chile.” At least one person has been detained so far in connection to the wildfires, CNN Chile reported. According to police, the man was at his home in the city of Talca in central Chile doing welding work when a fire accidentally started and spread to nearby grasslands. The suspect will be arraigned on Sunday in Talca, according to the Maule Prosecutor’s Office.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/climate/chile-wildfires-state-of-emergency-intl-hnk/index.html,"devastating wildfire tearing swathe chile killed one hundred people authority said sunday warned death toll set rise chilean national disaster prevention response service said least one hundred and twelve people died far official also said thirty-two body identified thirty-eight autopsy conducted ten body ready delivered relative news agency photograph footage weekend laid bare trail destruction wrought multiple community inferno aerial shot el olivar commune showed dozen vehicle burned shell alongside multiple house reduced ash one video obtained cnn showed inside bus ferrying passenger city valparaíso fire raged outside currently one hundred and sixty-one active fire burning across country chilean national disaster prevention response service senapred said senapred director álvaro hormazábal told cnn affiliate cnn chile firefighter controlled one hundred and two fire still battling forty others nineteen wildfire currently observation hormazábal added president gabriel boric declared state emergency coastal city like viña del mar valparaiso choked smoke resident living central region also forced evacuate home speaking press conference held visiting affected area sunday boric raised fear death toll would “ increase significantly ” televised statement saturday boric said defense ministry would deploy military unit affected area necessary resource made available declared monday tuesday day national mourning fire victim climate change el nino weather phenomenon driving force behind increasingly warm planet scientist say making event like heatwaves wildfire likely wildfire intensified around globe providing stark reminder climate crisis upending life inflicting billion dollar year damage get worse according expert “ uncontrollable devastating wildfire becoming expected part seasonal calendar many part world ” un environment programme said report published two thousand and twenty-two ﻿the number extreme wildfire event increase fourteen two thousand and thirty according un report two thousand and fifty increase climb thirty chile fire come country battle summer heatwave capital santiago sweltering consecutive day hot dry temperature climbing thirty-three degree celsius 914°f neighboring colombia battled recent wildfire declaring disaster also calling international help fight flame emergency crew ground chile prioritizing fire port city valparaíso proximity urban area local official said three hundred and seventy-two resident reported missing located seventy mile one hundred and thirteen kilometer northwest capital santiago chile ’ coast valparaiso popular tourist destination known colorful house idyllic hill historic old town valeria melipillán mayor quilpué city capital marga marga province central chile ’ valparaíso region told cnn chile wildfire “ probably largest ever ” region nearly one thousand, four hundred house municipality damaged melipillán added chile ’ finance minister mario marcel told reporter sunday preliminary estimate damage valaparaíso region expected reach “ hundred million dollar ” evacuation effort efficient living affected area want vacate home local search rescue official said rodrigo mundaca governor valparaiso said curfew place town viña del mar quilpué villa alemana limache allow authority focus battling blaze pope francis hail nearby argentina called upon people “ pray deceased injured victim devastating fire affected central chile ” least one person detained far connection wildfire cnn chile reported according police man home city talca central chile welding work fire accidentally started spread nearby grassland suspect arraigned sunday talca according maule prosecutor ’ office",6
63,‘That’s in his DNA’: Patrick Mahomes Sr. talks to CNN about Chiefs star’s ‘natural dad bod’ and his generational talent,"New York’s Rubin Museum of Art, home to one of the world’s largest and most important collections of Himalayan art, announced on Wednesday that it will close its doors in October. The museum, founded by Shelley and Donald Rubin two decades ago, houses nearly 4,000 Himalayan art objects, introducing visitors to elaborate paintings, religious sculptures and iconography from the region. But it, like many museums, has faced challenges in recent years, undergoing staff cuts and becoming embroiled in the debate around repatriation of artifacts with questionable provenance. The museum said in a public statement on its website that it will sell its Manhattan building to become a “museum without walls.” A new “global museum model” will see the Rubin loaning out items from its collection and organizing traveling exhibits, the statement added. “In our new incarnation, we are redefining what a museum can be,” Noah Dorsky, the museum’s board president said in a press release, adding that in recent years the role of a museum has “evolved dramatically” — as have the needs of the communities they serve. “Building and sharing this collection of Himalayan art was one of my family’s great joys,” added Shelley Rubin. “While it has been a privilege to welcome visitors to the Rubin in New York over the last 20 years, our anniversary inspired reflection on how we can achieve the greatest possible impact well into the future.” “The result is the firm belief that a more expansive model will allow us to best serve our mission — not changing ‘why’ we share Himalayan art with the world, but ‘how’ we do it,” she added. “Bold change has always been in the Rubin’s DNA, and we are excited to embrace what our future as a global museum has to offer.” The museum said it will expand its research and further invest in videos, podcasts, essays and other educational resources. It committed to “supporting and elevating” contemporary artists exploring Himalayan art — much of which is rooted in Buddhist traditions — and will continue research into the origins and acquisition of artifacts in its collection, saying it “vehemently opposes the trafficking of stolen or looted cultural items.” The Rubin recently repatriated three items in its collection that were determined to have been stolen, including a wooden carving returned to the Itumbaha monastery in Kathmandu, Nepal. The monastery’s new on-site museum was set up with help from the Rubin and local museologists. Announcing the closure of its Manhattan space, the Rubin sought to allay fears about its finances; a spokesperson for the museum told CNN in a statement that the decision to close its physical doors “is being made from a position of financial strength.” (The museum went through a restructuring in 2019, reducing staff, opening hours and programs, citing a need for “long-term sustainability.”) “The museum also achieved its highest-ever fundraising numbers in 2022 and 2023,” the spokesperson added, further noting that the Rubin’s endowment — some $150 million — “is of a scale of major NYC institutions and sets them up very well for the future (as) outlined.” “The significant resources required to own and operate a building in New York City will now be focused exclusively on our collection, exhibitions, programs and community of artists,” the museum’s executive director, Jorrit Britschgi, told CNN in an email. “In other words, this new model means more funds spent on sharing art, supporting artists and scholarship, and expanding on our flagship programs like Project Himalayan Art.” “In this decentralized model, we will be active in more geographic locations as well as non-traditional spaces, from parks to festivals and fairs,” Britschgi continued. “By doing so, we will exponentially expand the audiences we are able to engage with and inspire through Himalayan art.” “The art in our galleries teaches us that change is constant and inevitable,” Britschgi wrote in an open letter published on the Rubin’s website this week. “We take inspiration from this, as we boldly let go of an old model and redefine what it means to be a museum in the 21st century. We will build on partnerships and collaborations with people from the Himalayan region, diaspora, and beyond, and make our offerings available globally, supporting research, artistic expression and creativity.” The Rubin cited its work with Nepal’s first ever national pavilion at the Venice Biennale, the collaboration with the Itumbaha Museum and the Mandela Lab — which provides interactive experiences for emotional learning through Buddhist teachings — as examples of how it will fulfil its new role. But not all are convinced by the merits of closing the New York space. Ian Johnson, a senior fellow at the Centre for Foreign Relations, meanwhile lamented the museum’s closure as a “disaster for Tibetan art,” with the USA’s former Ambassador to the Asian Development Bank, Curtis S. Chin, responding to his post to say he was “saddened by this news.” “The Rubin did outstanding works over the years,” Johnson told CNN in an email. “In terms of Tibetan art, the (museum) was one of the few venues in the world that highlighted it, along with other Himalayan art — especially Nepalese — as separate. A lot of the time, we are shown Tibetan art as part of Chinese art — as an appendage because Tibet is now part of China. But this erases the region’s distinct historical identity.” The closure will see some 40% of the Rubin’s staff lose their jobs — mostly those in “front-of-house roles,” a spokesperson for the museum told CNN. The museum will maintain an office in the city and a secure location where researchers can access artifacts that are not out on loan. The Rubin will officially close on October 6, and its final exhibition will be the upcoming “Reimagine: Himalayan Art Now.” A number of existing projects — including “Project Himalayan Art,” an archive of physical and digital scholarly resources, as well as a curriculum used by schools and teachers in New York City — will continue. The Tibetan Buddhist Shrine Room, a visitor favorite, will be relocated to a new home.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/style/rubin-museum-closing-new-york/index.html,new york ’ rubin museum art home one world ’ largest important collection himalayan art announced wednesday close door october museum founded shelley donald rubin two decade ago house nearly four thousand himalayan art object introducing visitor elaborate painting religious sculpture iconography region like many museum faced challenge recent year undergoing staff cut becoming embroiled debate around repatriation artifact questionable provenance museum said public statement website sell manhattan building become “ museum without wall ” new “ global museum model ” see rubin loaning item collection organizing traveling exhibit statement added “ new incarnation redefining museum ” noah dorsky museum ’ board president said press release adding recent year role museum “ evolved dramatically ” — need community serve “ building sharing collection himalayan art one family ’ great joy ” added shelley rubin “ privilege welcome visitor rubin new york last twenty year anniversary inspired reflection achieve greatest possible impact well future ” “ result firm belief expansive model allow u best serve mission — changing ‘ ’ share himalayan art world ‘ ’ ” added “ bold change always rubin ’ dna excited embrace future global museum offer ” museum said expand research invest video podcasts essay educational resource committed “ supporting elevating ” contemporary artist exploring himalayan art — much rooted buddhist tradition — continue research origin acquisition artifact collection saying “ vehemently opposes trafficking stolen looted cultural item ” rubin recently repatriated three item collection determined stolen including wooden carving returned itumbaha monastery kathmandu nepal monastery ’ new onsite museum set help rubin local museologists announcing closure manhattan space rubin sought allay fear finance spokesperson museum told cnn statement decision close physical door “ made position financial strength ” museum went restructuring two thousand and nineteen reducing staff opening hour program citing need “ longterm sustainability ” “ museum also achieved highestever fundraising number two thousand and twenty-two two thousand and twenty-three ” spokesperson added noting rubin ’ endowment — one hundred and fifty million — “ scale major nyc institution set well future outlined ” “ significant resource required operate building new york city focused exclusively collection exhibition program community artist ” museum ’ executive director jorrit britschgi told cnn email “ word new model mean fund spent sharing art supporting artist scholarship expanding flagship program like project himalayan art ” “ decentralized model active geographic location well nontraditional space park festival fair ” britschgi continued “ exponentially expand audience able engage inspire himalayan art ” “ art gallery teach u change constant inevitable ” britschgi wrote open letter published rubin ’ website week “ take inspiration boldly let go old model redefine mean museum 21st century build partnership collaboration people himalayan region diaspora beyond make offering available globally supporting research artistic expression creativity ” rubin cited work nepal ’ first ever national pavilion venice biennale collaboration itumbaha museum mandela lab — provides interactive experience emotional learning buddhist teaching — example fulfil new role convinced merit closing new york space ian johnson senior fellow centre foreign relation meanwhile lamented museum ’ closure “ disaster tibetan art ” usa ’ former ambassador asian development bank curtis chin responding post say “ saddened news ” “ rubin outstanding work year ” johnson told cnn email “ term tibetan art museum one venue world highlighted along himalayan art — especially nepalese — separate lot time shown tibetan art part chinese art — appendage tibet part china era region ’ distinct historical identity ” closure see forty rubin ’ staff lose job — mostly “ frontofhouse role ” spokesperson museum told cnn museum maintain office city secure location researcher access artifact loan rubin officially close october six final exhibition upcoming “ reimagine himalayan art ” number existing project — including “ project himalayan art ” archive physical digital scholarly resource well curriculum used school teacher new york city — continue tibetan buddhist shrine room visitor favorite relocated new home,1
64,Liverpool striker Darwin Núñez continues to split opinion after setting unwanted Premier League record,"It has been pretty quiet on the tax beat of late. Billionaires have been calling for increased taxes on themselves, perhaps because they know that no such thing is going to happen anytime soon. Democrats continue to propose taxes on billionaires, perhaps because they know that no such thing is going to happen anytime soon. A relatively modest ($78 billion) bipartisan tax deal, which strengthens the child tax credit and extends some of the business tax breaks from former President Donald Trump’s Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, got through the House Wednesday but faces an uncertain future in the Senate. This is not surprising. It is hard to do anything meaningful about taxes in a presidential election year. Except, that is, to talk. Enter Nikki Haley. In a recent interview, while preparing for the critical South Carolina Republican presidential primary, Haley took aim at Trump’s call for more tariffs, specifically a 10% across-the-board charge on all imports: “This is a man who now wants to go and put 10% tariffs across the board, raising taxes on every single American. Think about that for a second.” Second, Haley is almost certainly right: tariffs can be a regressive tax, borne largely, if not exclusively, by ordinary American workers. The moderate, non-partisan Tax Foundation found that the existing Trump tariffs will bring in a mere $74 billion in revenues over ten years, while costing jobs, lowering growth and depressing American wages. The Tax Foundation claims that Trump’s latest tariff proposals would act as a $300 billion tax on most of us. OK, let us take Haley up on that, and think about it for a few seconds. Here are some thoughts: First off, Trump did impose tariffs in his time as president. They ranged from 7.5% to 25%. Second, the Trump campaign disputes that characterization of his new proposal, of course, (calling the Tax Foundation’s view “an economically illiterate statement put forward by a globalist Washington think tank funded by multinational corporate interests”) but we have known at least since Adam Smith that tariffs are generally poor tax (and trade) policy . Third, despite all the wailing and gnashing of teeth by liberals and progressives about Trump and his tariffs, the Biden-Harris administration has mostly kept them in place. Fourth, Trump, being Trump, has effectively doubled down, by proposing another 10% round of tariffs (the proposal criticized by Haley and the Tax Foundation) and even sextupled down, mulling a 60% tariff on China, in particular. Even if the first round of Trump tariffs produced modest revenues with modest downsides, the harms are likely to get worse as the rates rise, as we may recall from the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, which may well have exacerbated the Great Depression. So, after a few seconds of thought, here is the thing. Haley is right. Trump’s plan is to impose a 10% tariff that acts like a sales tax that will mainly fall on ordinary workers, the kind who shop at Walmart, although it is nominally targeted at foreigners. Who is likely to benefit most from any future Trump tax cuts? Likely the rich, the kind of people who do not shop at Walmart. This is perfect, inverse-Robin-Hood-Republican-tax-policy: take from the poor to give to the rich. This has been a through line from Herbert Hoover to Ronald Reagan and now Trump. One more thing: It is popular. Like the high schooler giving the perfect speech in running for class president, Haley is losing to the class clown promising Taco Tuesdays in the cafeteria.  The simple take-home on the tax rhetoric du jour?  Haley is right; Trump wins. Those who politically oppose Trump or his regressive tax policies forget at their peril his undeniable skills, even genius, at marketing. Trump University may have taught its students little of value, but they paid their tuition. We live in an age in which politicians create the “realities” they sell, as on “The Apprentice.” People hate taxes. A plan that makes it look as if those mean, cheating foreigners will pay our taxes for us sounds great, and who has time to check the math? The truth about tariffs is that they are a fee charged to people who import goods into the US. The government gets the revenue from the tariff, but the importer normally factors that amount into the price at which it sells products to Americans. So, consumers are ultimately footing the bill for tariffs like the ones Trump advocates. Here is some advice: If a politician pitches a tax plan that sounds too good to be true, check your wallet. And while we all learn to get better at understanding tax and the other laws that affect us, day to day, we can stop blaming the salespeople-politicians for pitching their plans. We get what we vote for. Caveat emptor, as they say.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/opinions/trump-haley-tax-tariffs-2024-presidency-mccaffery/index.html,"pretty quiet tax beat late billionaire calling increased tax perhaps know thing going happen anytime soon democrat continue propose tax billionaire perhaps know thing going happen anytime soon relatively modest seventy-eight billion bipartisan tax deal strengthens child tax credit extends business tax break former president donald trump ’ tax cut job act tcja two thousand and seventeen got house wednesday face uncertain future senate surprising hard anything meaningful tax presidential election year except talk enter nikki haley recent interview preparing critical south carolina republican presidential primary haley took aim trump ’ call tariff specifically ten acrosstheboard charge import “ man want go put ten tariff across board raising tax every single american think second ” second haley almost certainly right tariff regressive tax borne largely exclusively ordinary american worker moderate nonpartisan tax foundation found existing trump tariff bring mere seventy-four billion revenue ten year costing job lowering growth depressing american wage tax foundation claim trump ’ latest tariff proposal would act three hundred billion tax u ok let u take haley think second thought first trump impose tariff time president ranged seventy-five twenty-five second trump campaign dispute characterization new proposal course calling tax foundation ’ view “ economically illiterate statement put forward globalist washington think tank funded multinational corporate interest ” known least since adam smith tariff generally poor tax trade policy third despite wailing gnashing teeth liberal progressive trump tariff bidenharris administration mostly kept place fourth trump trump effectively doubled proposing another ten round tariff proposal criticized haley tax foundation even sextupled mulling sixty tariff china particular even first round trump tariff produced modest revenue modest downside harm likely get worse rate rise may recall smoothawley act one thousand, nine hundred and thirty may well exacerbated great depression second thought thing haley right trump ’ plan impose ten tariff act like sale tax mainly fall ordinary worker kind shop walmart although nominally targeted foreigner likely benefit future trump tax cut likely rich kind people shop walmart perfect inverserobinhoodrepublicantaxpolicy take poor give rich line herbert hoover ronald reagan trump one thing popular like high schooler giving perfect speech running class president haley losing class clown promising taco tuesday cafeteria simple takehome tax rhetoric du jour haley right trump win politically oppose trump regressive tax policy forget peril undeniable skill even genius marketing trump university may taught student little value paid tuition live age politician create “ reality ” sell “ apprentice ” people hate tax plan make look mean cheating foreigner pay tax u sound great time check math truth tariff fee charged people import good u government get revenue tariff importer normally factor amount price sell product american consumer ultimately footing bill tariff like one trump advocate advice politician pitch tax plan sound good true check wallet learn get better understanding tax law affect u day day stop blaming salespeoplepoliticians pitching plan get vote caveat emptor say",5
65,The Olympics has a first-ever beer sponsor – but not everyone is happy about it,"Connecticut will cancel roughly $650 million in medical debt for an estimated 250,000 residents this year, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday, saying it is the first state to provide this type of relief. The effort will liberate many residents from “the cloud” over their heads and give them more freedom to buy a home, start a business or continue with their education, Lamont told CNN. That will help them strengthen their financial standing in a state with a large wealth gap. “It’s a debt that you had no control over,” Lamont told CNN. “It’s not like you overspent. You get hit by a health care calamity.” Residents whose medical debt equals 5% or more of their annual income or whose household income is up to 400% of the federal poverty line, or about $125,000 in 2024, are eligible. Those who qualify do not need to apply – they will receive letters in the mail saying their debt has been eliminated as soon as this summer. More than 1 in 10 Connecticut residents have medical debt in collections. Lamont first announced the initiative, which was included in Connecticut’s most recent budget, on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Friday. The state will leverage $6.5 million in Covid-19 funds from the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act to satisfy the debt. It will contract with a nonprofit group that buys medical debt from hospitals and eliminates it for much less than what’s owed. Connecticut joins a growing number of governments that are wiping out residents’ unpaid medical bills. New Jersey included $10 million in its most recent budget to fund a pilot program to cancel residents’ medical debt, and Gov. Phil Murphy last month called on the state Legislature to expand the effort in the coming budget. “For every dollar invested, we can retire up to $100 in debt – for tens of thousands of people,” Murphy said in his State of the State address. New York City last month said it would eliminate more than $2 billion in medical debt for up to 500,000 residents over the next three years. Many governments are working with RIP Medical Debt, a nonprofit founded in 2014. It can often buy debt directly from hospitals and other health care providers for a penny on the dollar, mimicking the deals that for-profit debt collectors are able to strike, said Allison Sesso, CEO of the charity. It has signed contracts or is working with about 30 governments, including cities, counties and states – many of which are using American Rescue Plan Act funds to pay for the initiatives. However, she noted, the efforts can’t guarantee that all of a person’s medical debt will be canceled. Helping patients contend with medical debt is in the spotlight as Americans deal with the high cost of health care. The exact amount owed is difficult to pin down, but a KFF analysis of 2020 Census Bureau data found that US adults carry at least $195 billion in medical debt. Nearly 1 in 10 American adults have medical debt of over $250, with Black Americans and middle-aged residents more likely to be in this situation, according to KFF. A separate analysis last year by Third Way, a center-left think tank, found that the middle class is the hardest hit by unpaid health care bills. Medical debt is now the largest source of debt in collections, totaling more than credit cards, utilities and auto loans combined, according to the White House. The three largest credit reporting agencies announced in 2022 that they would remove nearly 70% of medical debt from consumer credit reports. And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Biden administration are also considering ways to minimize the burden of medical debt.

The Beatles were in the middle of a tour that had them play five shows in just three days at Japan’s famed Nippon Budokan arena — but when they weren’t performing, they were holed up in the presidential suite of the Tokyo Hilton creating a work of art that came to be known as “Images of a Woman.” That painting, believed by some experts to be the only artwork jointly made by all four Beatles (or at least signed by all four), was sold at Christie’s auction house in New York on February 1. “Images of a Woman” was estimated to fetch somewhere in the realm of $400,000 to $600,000 and “crystallizes a magic moment in Beatles history,” said Christie’s specialist Casey Rogers during a phone interview. Its final sale price was nearly three times the high end of that estimate — $1,744,000. “It’s such a rarity to have a work on paper outside of their music catalog that is (a) physical relic, this tangible object with contributions from all four of The Beatles,” Rogers said of the 21.5- by 31-inch painting. “It’s memorabilia, it’s a work of art, it appeals to probably a much larger cross-section of collectors… It’s a wonderful piece of storytelling.” As the story goes, the Fab Four spent about 100 hours in Japan during their 1966 tour. Outside of performing (and aside from two instances where Paul McCartney and John Lennon each slipped out with members of their entourage for sightseeing adventures in Tokyo), the group stayed put in their hotel room at the behest of local authorities who were concerned about their safety. The band’s visit to the country drew adoring fans and protesters alike — there were reports of threats from Japanese nationalists, including some angry about a Western rock band playing an arena considered a spiritual home for martial arts. A visitor gifted them some art supplies, according to Christie’s press release; the band soon wound up around a table, with a blank sheet of Japanese art paper in the middle and a lamp roughly centered on top of it. Each Beatle sat at a corner, painting something different. Recordings for the album that would become “Revolver” played in the background. Photographer Robert Whitaker, who was represented by the band’s manager Brian Epstein, was on hand to capture the group at work. “I never saw them calmer or more contented than at this time,” he observed, according to Christie’s release. The Beatles were no strangers to visual art. Lennon attended art school and McCartney had studied the subject, too. Both George Harrison and Ringo Starr drew “often and with plenty of talent,” the Christie’s press release added. Each corner of the painting reflects a personal touch, with plenty of variety in shapes, colors and even the paints used. Harrison’s portion, which uses darker and angrier-looking brush strokes, seems to sprawl out the most from his corner, while Starr’s area is smaller and cartoonish. Both Lennon and McCartney worked primarily in acrylic, Christie’s noted, while Harrison and Starr relied more on watercolor. And then at the center, where the lamp once sat, are the signatures. The Beatles never gave their painting an official title, but it became known as “Images of a Woman” in the late 1980s when “a Japanese journalist thought he could see female genitals in Paul’s quadrant,” according to Christie’s. “It’s all very much in the eye of the beholder, isn’t it?” said Rogers. “It wasn’t the intention, necessarily, of the painting as it was being done. I think it was more fluid, it was more freeform and just the members expressing themselves.” “It’s really interesting that it’s had other interpretations over time and probably will carry on having other interpretations.” After its completion, the painting was acquired by Tetsusaburo Shimoyama, an entertainment industry executive who was then the chairman of Tokyo’s Beatles fan club. In 1989, it was purchased by record store owner Takao Nishino, The Atlantic reported in 2012, when Nishino in turn put “Images of a Woman” up for auction. (Nishino had, for some years, stored the piece under a bed, the magazine noted.) After Nishino had decided to part ways with the painting, he told The Atlantic: “Originally, I thought it might be best kept as a piece of Japan’s cultural heritage; it has never left Japanese soil in 46 years. But the Beatles phenomenon was and remains a global one.” Beatlemania has continued in the decades since the band broke up, and as Rogers noted, “they’re never out of the headlines.” Interest in the band’s music, its members’ lives and their contributions to pop culture play a large part in their “perennial” appeal, she said. “We’re even seeing them in the news as recently as (last month) with the help of AI,” she said, nodding to the release of “Now and Then,” a long-unfinished song now completed using artificial intelligence. “Images of a Woman” was part of Christie’s “Exceptional Sale,” a yearly auction event held in New York, London and Paris. “These are masterpiece level, often one-of-a-kind rare objects with historical importance,” said Rogers, who noted that The Beatles’ painting was up for auction alongside other rock and roll memorabilia, as well as fine works of art, sports-related artifacts and more. Though not widely celebrated, or even known, “Images of a Woman” was the unique result of a particular moment in the band’s career. By the end of August 1966, less than two months after leaving Japan, The Beatles had played their last concert — one 1969 rooftop performance notwithstanding — at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park, putting an end to rigorous touring and shifting their focus to studio work. “I think (‘Images of a Woman’) is really reflective of those 100 hours that they spent together… probably one of the last times to sit together, to reflect, to not have schedules that required them anywhere else but Budokan for their concerts,” said Rogers. “And maybe, at the same time, it was a release during this lockdown,” she noted. “Just this great creative outlet for them.”",https://edition.cnn.com/style/beatles-japan-painting-1966-auction-cec/index.html,"summer one thousand, nine hundred and sixty-six

67,New York’s Rubin Museum is closing its doors — but will live on as a ‘museum without walls’,"Catfishing is when a person uses false information and images to create a fake identity online with the intention to trick, harass, or scam another person. It is often on social media or dating apps and websites as a common tactic used to form online relationships under false pretenses, sometimes to lure people into financial scams. The person doing the pretending, or the “catfish” may also obtain intimate images from a victim and use them to extort or blackmail the person. This is known as sextortion, or they may use other personal information shared with them to commit identity theft. The term is believed to originate from the 2010 documentary “Catfish,” in which a young Nev Schulman starts an online relationship with teenager “Megan”, who turns out to be an older woman. In the final scene of the documentary, the woman’s husband shares an anecdote about how live cod used to be exported from Alaska alongside catfish, which kept the cod active and alert. He likened this to people in real life who keep others on their toes, like his wife. Schulman went on to produce the docuseries Catfish There are many reasons people resort to catfishing, but the most common reason is a lack of confidence, according to the Cybersmile Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital well-being. The foundation states that if someone is not happy with themselves, they may feel happier when pretending to be someone more attractive to others. They may also hide their identity to troll someone; to engage in a relationship other than their existing one; or to extort or harass people. Some people may catfish to explore sexual preferences. Studies have shown that catfish are more likely to be educated men, with one 2022 study finding perpetrators are more likely to come from religious backgrounds, possibly providing a way to form relationships without the constraints they face in real life, the authors write. In another study published last year, Evita March, senior lecturer in psychology at Federation University in Australia, found that people with the strong personality traits of sadism, psychopathy, and narcissism were more likely to catfish. March told CNN the findings are preliminary and that her team would like to further investigate if certain personality traits lead to specific kinds of catfishing behavior. In the US, romance scams resulting from catfishing have among the highest reported financial losses of internet crimes as a whole. A total of 19,050 Americans reported losing almost $740 million to romance scammers in 2022. In the UK, the country’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau received more than 8,000 reports of romance fraud in the 2022 financial year, totaling more than £92 million (US $116.6 million) lost, with an average loss of £11,500 (US $14,574) per victim. In Singapore, romance scams are among the top 10 reported scams. The reported amount of money catfish may get from their victims increased by more than 30% from SGD$33.1 million (US $24 million) in 2020 to $46.6 million (US $34 million) the following year. Catfishing is also increasingly happening on an industrial scale with the rise of “cyber scam centers” that have links to human trafficking in Southeast Asia, according to INTERPOL. Victims of trafficking are forced to become fraudsters by creating fake social media accounts and dating profiles to scam and extort millions of dollars from people around the world using different schemes such as fake crypto investment sites. Catfishing used to occur more among adults through online dating sites, but has now become equally common among teenagers, according to the Cybersmile Foundation. Research by Snapchat last year with more than 6,000 Gen Z teenagers and young people in Australia, France, Germany, India, the UK and the US found that almost two-thirds of them or their friends had been targeted by catfish or hackers to obtain private images that were later used to extort them. Older people are also likely to lose more money to catfishing. In 2021, Americans lost half a billion dollars through romance scams perpetrated by people using fake personas or impersonating others, with the largest losses paid in cryptocurrency, according to the US Federal Trade Commission. The number of reports rose tenfold among young people (18-29) but older people (over 70s) generally reported losing more money. In Australia, a third of dating and romance scams result in financial losses, with women having lost more than double the total amount lost by men, and older people again losing more money than those under 45, according to data from the country’s National Anti-Scam Centre. ”Romance scams are one of the hardest things to avoid. It’s emotional manipulation,” said Ngo Minh Hieu, a Vietnamese former hacker and founder of Chong Lua Dao (scam fighters), a cybersecurity non-profit. Since 2020, Hieu has been monitoring trends to help scam victims, he says, and explains that in his experience, a catfish would usually approach a victim with premediated intention to scam them. They were likely to be using personal information that they mine from the victim’s social media accounts, or may have bought that data from users in private chat groups simply by providing a phone number of a potential victim. There are many signs you can look for to help spot a catfish, experts say. Firstly, a catfish might contact you out of nowhere, start regular conversations with you and shower you with compliments to quickly build up trust and rapport. They may state desirable qualities in their opening conversations, including wealth or attractiveness, but then rarely or never call you, either over the phone or on a video call. They often do not have many friends on social media and their posts are usually scarce. Search results using their name may not yield many results and their stories are usually inconsistent. For example, personal details like where they live or go to school might change when discussed again. Another classic sign is if the feelings they declare for you escalate quickly and after a short period of time. A catfish may ask you for sensitive images and money. Many scammers use already available photos of other people in their fake personas, which may be possible to spot using a reverse image search. With the explosion of AI technology, scammers may now generate unique and realistic images for use as profile pictures. But Hieu explains that thanks to their built-in patterns by design, AI-generated images can be detected, using tools such as AI-Generated Image Detector. If you believe you are being catfished, there are steps you can take to protect yourself and help end the targeting. Experts advise that you should not be afraid to ask direct questions or challenge the person you believe may be catfishing you. You can do this by asking them why they are not willing to call you or meet face to face, or questioning how they can declare their love for you so quickly. Fangzhou Wang, a cybercrime professor at the University of Texas at Arlington, and her colleagues sent nearly 200 deterrent messages to active scammers in a 2020 study and concluded that this could make fraudsters respond less or in some cases, admit to wrongdoing. An example of one of the messages was: “I know you are scamming innocent people. My friend was recently arrested for the same offense and is facing five years in prison. You should stop before you face the same fate.” You should think about stopping all communications with the catfish, and refrain from sending money to them at the risk of further financial demands. Experts say catfish continue to target those who engage with them more. It’s also useful to secure your online accounts and ensure your personal information is kept private online. Cybersecurity expert Hieu explained that you can do this by putting personal information such as your phone number, email addresses and date of birth in private mode on social media. You can also check if your email has been compromised in a data breach by using tools such as the Have I Been Pwned website. Installing two-factor authentication on your accounts can also help protect against unauthorized access. That requires you to take a second step to verify your identity when logging in to a service, for example by SMS or a physical device, such as a key fob. Being subjected to catfishing can also have a significant impact on your mental health, with many victims left unable to trust others and some left feeling embarrassed about falling for the scam. A 2019 study found that young LGBTQ+ men in rural America experiencing catfishing on dating apps felt angry and fearful. If someone was “sextorted,” they may continue to fear their images resurfacing online in the future. March from Federation University in Australia recommended improving digital literacy and staying aware of the potential red flags. She also emphasized the need to recognize today’s loneliness epidemic, which “leads people to perhaps be more susceptible to catfishing scams,” she said. Seeking professional support from a counselor or talking to supportive friends and family is one way to address loneliness, March added. Catfishing is not explicitly a crime, but the actions that often accompany catfishing, such as extortion for money, gifts or sexual images are crimes in many places. The main challenge in tackling online fraud is the issue of jurisdiction, according to a 2020 paper about police handling of online fraud victims in Australia. Traditional policing operates within specific territories, but the internet has blurred these boundaries, the author writes. Cybercriminals from one country can also target victims in other countries, complicating law enforcement efforts, and victims often face difficulty and frustration when trying to report cybercrimes, which can further traumatize them. Wang told CNN that virtual private networks (VPNs), forged credentials, and anonymous communication methods make it extremely difficult to determine identities or locations. Scammers have also capitalized on the proliferation of AI, such as AI-generated personas, which complicates the ability of law enforcement authorities to gather evidence and build cases against a catfish. ”Law enforcement agencies, often constrained by limited resources and prioritizing cases based on severity and direct impact, might not readily prioritize catfishing cases without substantial financial losses or physical harm,” Wang told CNN. In the US, there are some legal precedents. In 2022, a woman who had created multiple fake profiles to target wealthy men was charged with extortion, cyberstalking, and interstate threats and was sentenced in a plea deal last year. In the UK, while catfishing itself is not classified as a criminal offense, if the person using a fake profile engages in illegal activities, like financial gain or harassment, they can be punished by law. China has a law that implicates people who allow their websites or communications platforms to be used for frauds and other illegal activities under Article 46 in the Cybersecurity Law. If a catfish has tricked you into sending them money, you can go to the authorities and your bank immediately, depending on where you are. If activities that are crimes in your country have taken place because of being catfished, such as extortion, identify theft or harassment, the police or other authorities, such as specific commissions targeting online crime, may be your first port of call. The Australian government’s agency responsible for online safety, the e-safety commissioner, advises that people gather all the evidence they can, including screenshots of the scammer and chats with them to keep as evidence. Depending on the case, you can also submit an abuse or impersonation report against the catfish directly to the platform on which you are communicating with them. If you believe the person you are talking to is not who they say they are, most of the larger social media platforms give you the option report them for impersonation or other forms of abuse, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, X, Telegram, Tinder and WhatsApp. WeChat also offers a channel to report another user for harassment, fraud, or illegal activity, while Telegram creates an anti-scam thread for users to report on fraudsters. You are not responsible for the catfish behaviors of others, but staying vigilant and alert online goes a long way. Make sure your online accounts are secured and use two-factor authentication. When browsing the internet, you may want to use a virtual private network (VPN) which makes your internet activity harder to track. In many countries such as the US, the UK and Australia, victims have reported being preyed on by catfish who tricked them to put money in bogus cryptocurrency investment sites. If someone you have been talking to asks you to put money into an investment site, think twice. The Global Anti-Scam Organization has a database of fraudulent websites generated by their own investigations and the public’s tip offs to help inform you if you’re being scammed. If you are a parent, this guide provided by the UK-based National College platform suggests communicating effectively and sensitively with your children about the risks. You may also help them report and block the catfish accounts and report to police if they have been subjected to anything illegal or inappropriate. Because catfish get close to a target often by relying on personal information posted on social media, UNICEF asks children to consider their rights when it comes to parents sharing their pictures and other content online, especially when they are underage.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/29/tech/catfishing-explained-what-to-do-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html,"catfishing person us false information

68,Look of the Week: Is Demi Moore bringing back the handbag dog?,"The human-canine bond is widely regarded as special. But the union between celebrities and chihuahuas? Sacred. This week, while completing a press tour around New York for the FX series, “Feud: Capote vs. the Swans,” Demi Moore was hardly seen without her 1.5 pound dog, Pilaf, nestled in her elbow. From talk show tapings, autograph signings and even the Saturday Night Live afterparty, Pilaf was practically part of the furniture — or at least part of the outfit. In the daytime, when Moore was snapped wearing an oversized wool coat and slacks, or wide leg jeans and a graphic tee, her chihuahua was tucked casually into a sleek black sling. But when the occasion called for a little more glamor — as was the case on Wednesday evening, when Moore donned a Versace lace cut-out blazer dress to appear on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert — Pilaf was held proudly in her owner’s palm like a fluffy tan clutch bag. “My little teeny tiny companion,” she told Colbert on air. “She is a treasure, she’s like my little extra heart.” Of course, Moore isn’t the first A-lister to partner-up with a petite pooch. In the 2000s, miniature dogs were considered a must-have fashion accessory. During the height of her influence, Paris Hilton was regularly seen with a fleet of chihuahuas in tow. Tinkerbell, Diamond Baby and Harajuku Bitch (who passed away just last year) were often dressed in complementary outfits and considered extensions of Hilton’s hyper feminine fashion identity. Elle Woods from “Legally Blonde,” whose on-screen look was widely regarded to be inspired by Hilton, is not only constantly color-blocked in pink, but also never without her chihuahua, Bruiser. Lindsay Lohan named her micro-mini maltese Gucci, after the pup ate her first ever luxury fashion purchase; while in the 2010s, a caramel-colored maltipoo (a maltese-poodle cross) was permanently wedged under Blake Lively’s armpit. But many animal rights groups and shelters thought the idea of designer dogs was degrading — specifically that forcing animals to wear clothes, or exist for lengths of time inside a Louis Vuitton handbag was “harmful.” Certain miniature breeds, too, came with serious health issues that were often overlooked for their cutesy appearance. In 2015, a report from UK animal welfare charity Blue Cross revealed chihuahuas and other previously fashionable teacup-sized dogs were being abandoned across the country at record numbers. Thankfully, Pilaf is likely a rescue dog. Moore is known to adopt and foster abandoned puppies (she currently has 10 at her home in Idaho) and is staunchly anti-puppy farms.

69,The Beatles created a painting together while on tour in Japan. It sold at auction for $1.7 million,"A Chinese-Australian writer has received a suspended death penalty in China, five years after he was detained on espionage charges, according to Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong. Yang Hengjun, an Australian citizen and democracy activist born in China, was sentenced Monday by a court in Beijing, Wong said in a statement, adding that the Australian government was “appalled” by the sentence. “We understand this can be commuted to life imprisonment after two years if the individual does not commit any serious crimes in the two-year period,” Wong said. “This is harrowing news for Dr Yang, his family and all who have supported him. Our thoughts are with them.” Yang, 58, was detained in 2019 at the airport when he arrived in the southern city of Guangzhou with his wife from New York to see family in China. He was later charged with espionage – accusations he has denied. Yang’s case has been shrouded in secrecy. Chinese authorities have offered no details on his charges – including which country he was accused of spying for. In 2021, his trial was held behind closed doors in a heavily guarded court in Beijing, to which Australian diplomats were denied entry. The verdict and sentence were repeatedly delayed. China’s court system is notoriously opaque – especially on cases involving national security – and has a conviction rate of above 99%, according to legal observers. Yang has suffered from poor health in detention. Last year, Yang said he feared he might die in prison, after a large cyst was found on his kidney. Australia has advocated for Yang with China “at every opportunity, and at the highest levels,” said Wong, the Australian foreign minister, in her statement. She vowed to continue to press for Yang’s interests and wellbeing, including appropriate medical treatment, and provide consular assistance to him and his family. At a news conference Monday, Wong said she had summoned China’s ambassador, Xiao Qian, to explain the sentence, while acknowledging it was a “decision of the Chinese legal system.” “All Australians want to see Dr Yang reunited with his family,” Wong said, adding that Yang has “options” to appeal the sentence. Feng Chongyi, Yang’s friend and former PhD supervisor in Australia, called his sentence a “barbarous act by the Chinese Communist regime.” “Yang is punished by the Chinese government for his criticism of human rights abuses in China and his advocacy for universal values such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law,” he said. “This is outraging political persecution and an unacceptable arbitrary imprisonment of an innocent Australian citizen.” Feng also expressed concern for Yang’s health, saying he is now “critically ill” and calling on the Australian government to arrange medical parole for Yang and bring him back to Australia as soon as possible. Yang worked as an official with the Chinese Foreign Ministry before emigrating to Australia. Before his detention, he routinely posted satirical commentaries critical of the Chinese government to his nearly 130,000 followers on X, previously known as Twitter. He also wrote a series of spy novels. Though he holds Australian citizenship, Yang is known to spend most of his time in the United States, where he was a visiting scholar at Columbia University in New York. Yang’s sentence was also condemned by human rights groups. Daniela Gavshon, Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said the sentence was “catastrophic” for Yang and his family and called for “stronger action” from Canberra to increase pressure on Beijing. “After years of arbitrary detention, allegations of torture, a closed and unfair trial without access to his own choice of lawyers – a sentence as severe as this is alarming,” she said. “It shines a light on Beijing’s opaque criminal justice system, which the Chinese Communist Party controls.” It is not the first time the fate of Australians caught up in national security cases have sparked tensions between Beijing and Canberra. Last October, Australian TV anchor Cheng Lei was released by China and returned home to her family more than three years after she was detained on opaque espionage charges. Cheng, a former business anchor for China’s state broadcaster CGTN and mother of two, was accused of illegally supplying state secrets overseas. Beijing did not reveal details of the allegations against Cheng throughout her three years of detention, and the Chinese court delayed handing down verdict multiple times.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/05/china/china-sentences-australian-yang-hengjun-suspended-death-intl-hnk/index.html,chineseaustralian writer received suspended death penalty china five year detained espionage charge according australian foreign minister penny wong yang hengjun australian citizen democracy activist born china sentenced monday court beijing wong said statement adding australian government “ appalled ” sentence “ understand commuted life imprisonment two year individual commit serious crime twoyear period ” wong said “ harrowing news dr yang family supported thought ” yang fifty-eight detained two thousand and nineteen airport arrived southern city guangzhou wife new york see family china later charged espionage – accusation denied yang ’ case shrouded secrecy chinese authority offered detail charge – including country accused spying two thousand and twenty-one trial held behind closed door heavily guarded court beijing australian diplomat denied entry verdict sentence repeatedly delayed china ’ court system notoriously opaque – especially case involving national security – conviction rate ninety-nine according legal observer yang suffered poor health detention last year yang said feared might die prison large cyst found kidney australia advocated yang china “ every opportunity highest level ” said wong australian foreign minister statement vowed continue press yang ’ interest wellbeing including appropriate medical treatment provide consular assistance family news conference monday wong said summoned china ’ ambassador xiao qian explain sentence acknowledging “ decision chinese legal system ” “ australian want see dr yang reunited family ” wong said adding yang “ option ” appeal sentence feng chongyi yang ’ friend former phd supervisor australia called sentence “ barbarous act chinese communist regime ” “ yang punished chinese government criticism human right abuse china advocacy universal value human right democracy rule law ” said “ outraging political persecution unacceptable arbitrary imprisonment innocent australian citizen ” feng also expressed concern yang ’ health saying “ critically ill ” calling australian government arrange medical parole yang bring back australia soon possible yang worked official chinese foreign ministry emigrating australia detention routinely posted satirical commentary critical chinese government nearly one hundred and thirty thousand follower x previously known twitter also wrote series spy novel though hold australian citizenship yang known spend time united state visiting scholar columbia university new york yang ’ sentence also condemned human right group daniela gavshon australia director human right watch said sentence “ catastrophic ” yang family called “ stronger action ” canberra increase pressure beijing “ year arbitrary detention allegation torture closed unfair trial without access choice lawyer – sentence severe alarming ” said “ shine light beijing ’ opaque criminal justice system chinese communist party control ” first time fate australian caught national security case sparked tension beijing canberra last october australian tv anchor cheng lei released china returned home family three year detained opaque espionage charge cheng former business anchor china ’ state broadcaster cgtn mother two accused illegally supplying state secret overseas beijing reveal detail allegation cheng throughout three year detention chinese court delayed handing verdict multiple time,8
70,"Before you get a Spotify tattoo, artists want you to know these risks","Most travelers hold their own unique bucket list of destinations, but how many have every single country in the world listed? While the number of people who’ve been able to achieve this is still relatively small – reportedly estimated at around 400 or so – more and more are going all out to achieve this feat. In fact, 2023 saw a record 50 new entries joining the coveted list of people who’ve traveled to all 195 UN-recognized countries and territories, according to NomadMania, an online platform that allows global explorers to track their travels. So what inspires someone to seek to travel to every country, and how difficult is this to actually achieve? Finnish writer and foreign correspondent Rauli Virtanen, who grew up in a rural village, is believed to be the first person to have visited all of the countries in the world. While there were fewer UN-recognised countries (170) when Virtanen achieved this goal in 1988, he says he’s “been adding the new ones” in the years since then. When questioned about the motivation behind his desire to visit every country, Virtanen puts it down to “extreme curiosity and collector´s mentality.” “In the mid ’80s, I noticed that I had already been to 150 countries and thought that maybe before I die, I can visit the rest of them,” he tells CNN Travel via email. Virtanen may well have completed this challenge in the late 1980s, but the notion of travelers “collecting countries” dates back much further. The Travelers’ Century Club (TCC,) an organization for people who’ve visited 100 or more of the world’s countries and territories, first launched in 1954 and is still going strong today. In the years since then, further platforms, such as competitive travel community Most Traveled People (MTP,) and Nomad Mania, have emerged. “I think it’s always been there as an intrinsic motivation to roam, but historically, travel was limited to people with the financial resources, career flexibility, and great health,” says Michael O’Regan, a Tourism and Events lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University in the UK. O’Regan goes on to point out that more people have the means to earn money while traveling now, while many are choosing to travel after early retirement. “Before, you might have needed ‘connections’ in particular countries, [or] have difficulty in getting visas or invitations,” he says. “You needed a ‘strong’ passport, and access to resources, such as tour guides and insider knowledge about transport and hotels.” Of course, this isn’t the case for many travelers today thanks in part to low-cost air carriers, visa on arrivals, and online booking systems, notes O’Regan. “It’s much easier to travel and clock up country visits (especially if you count stopovers, or transits,)” he adds. Patrick Gilliland from the US is among the many people who’ve opted to devote their later years to traveling the world. Like many of those who’ve been finishing off the last country’s on their list in recent years, his epic adventure was delayed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which brought about border closures and lockdowns, with some countries keeping restrictions in place for longer than others. But the 62-year-old was finally able to achieve his dream last year after many years on the move. “I never really thought it was possible to visit every country until the last few years,” he tells CNN Travel. “I figured certain places would be too dangerous or visas impossible.” Gilliland, who’s spent at least 48 weeks of the year traveling in recent years, acknowledges that getting access to every country wasn’t easy and involved “a bit of luck and timing.” “I visited North Korea 20 years ago when relations were better with the US, “ he says. “I tried several times over the years to get an Iran visa, Nauru is so little visited that the visa is difficult and decisions are on the whim of an individual.” When he arrived in his final country, Libya, which had just re-opened to US citizens, in September, he was initially denied entry at the airport. Of the select few travelers who’ve visited every country, the majority, if not all, appear to have had a significant number of countries ticked off before taking on the challenge. Slovakian travel blogger Martina Sebova had already visited over 100 of the 195 UN-recognized countries and territories on the globe before deciding to visit the remaining countries with her Australian partner Rachel Davey. “I think it would terrify me if I had to start visiting every country and I’d been to like 10,” Sebova told CNN Travel in 2023. “I don’t really think that that’s even viable. You need to be well traveled [before doing something like this].” The explosion of social media, which first became popular in the early noughties, has undoubtedly played a huge role in the rise of people attempting to visit every country. “The advent of social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok mean, some will be continually inspired by others who are pursuing this goal of visiting X, Y or Z across the globe,” says O’Regan. “It now seems more accessible and feasible than ever before.” However, it’s worth noting that this accessibility is ultimately limited to those who have the financial means to travel frequently, as well as a passport that allows them to go to any destination that they want to. This is an uncomfortable reality for Virtanen, who admits that he’s developed “mixed feelings” about his incredible accomplishment over the years. “I have been very fortunate,” he acknowledges, before explaining that he was able to visit 95% of the countries through his work, and would never have been able to afford to travel to so many places otherwise. “I had editors who signed my travel expenses and accepted my ideas to travel to distant countries so that my readers and viewers would know what’s going on. “I belong to that very tiny minority of people, born and educated in wealthy countries, who can afford to travel anywhere in the world. I have a kind of guilty feeling about that – if you understand me – and therefore I never tell people in poorer countries that I have visited all the countries of the world.” Jamaican born traveler Romaine Welds had few opportunities to see the world before he moved to the US in 2007 and began working for an airline. In fact, he’d never left Jamaica before then, and recalls looking at the country’s blue mountains and wondering what lay beyond them. “My family was poor and no-one in my family traveled, except for my father who would travel back and forth between England and Jamaica once in a few years,” he explains via email. After making the most of the free and discounted flights he was able to get through his job, Welds starting visiting his “bucket list places” and managed to travel to 100 countries. When he realized he was “halfway there,” he set about visiting the other 95 UN-recognized countries, with the aim of being the first Jamaican and Caribbean person to do so. He visited his final country, Antigua, in 2022. “It’s very special for me to be in a country as a Jamaican and represent the country,” he adds, recalling how rare it was to see people traveling extensively while he was growing up. The length of time travelers take to visit every country in the world tends to vary. While Welds was able to complete it in around 15 years, it took Gilliland around four decades. Some travelers have been racing to achieve it in record time – with Taylor Demonbreun from Canada currently holding the title of ‘fastest time to visit all sovereign countries’ (overall) after achieving this in one year and 189 days. This competitiveness is something of a concern for Virtanen, who admits to being critical when he sees people seemingly “hopping from one place to another one and the only information we get from them in each country is selfies promoting themselves.” “Lately it has been very easy to visit every country in the world, if you have the money and [the] right passport,” he adds. “We are not a ‘tribe’ of Lonely Planet guide book-carrying backpackers anymore. The motivations are changing. “The majority is still a curious explorer type, but also vanity is taking over now when globetrotting is becoming so easy.” Becoming part of the elite group of travelers who’ve visited every country in the world can certainly open up further opportunities. A number, including Ugandan-American travel influencer Jessica Nabongo, who became the first Black woman to document traveling to every country in the world in 2019, and Gunnar Garfors, believed to be the first person to visit every country in the world twice, have released books about their experiences. Last year, search aggregator and travel agency Skyscanner launched a pop-up “Everywhere Agency” that connects travelers with people who have visited every country across the globe – among them Garfors and Basanth Sadasivan, one of the youngest people to visit every country in the world. While O’Regan acknowledges that some travelers are “propelled by an uncontrollable urge” to visit every country, he feels that “collecting countries” in such a way can “promote superficial travel that neglects deeper cultural understanding or connection.” “There is incentive to hop regions quickly and risk the very things we want to recover from: physical and mental burnout,” says O’Regan. “It undervalues travel’s potential for cultural exchange, self-reflection, and the concepts of slow travel and sustainability.” When it comes to the question of speed, Welds concedes that each traveler will “have their goals,” but feels that it’s important to “travel slowly and enjoy each country.” “I think if you really want to see the world, you will take time,” he tells CNN Travel. “To each person their own, but I wouldn’t race around the world. It’s just a waste of money in my eyes.” The idea of what constitutes a true “visit” has been a hot topic of discussion in recent years, with many travelers disagreeing on what the criteria should be. Last year, NomadMania produced detailed guidelines on this subject after polling its users in 2022 and 2023. “It has been important for me to get to know as much as I can about each country we visit,” says Gilliland, explaining that he sometimes spent up to six weeks in a country while completing the challenge, but only spent around half a day in smaller countries like Monaco and Luxembourg. “My opinion regarding a ‘visit’ is that airport stops/transits won’t qualify,” says Virtanen. “Visiting [the] DMZ is not a visit to North Korea… Always go through the immigration… “Stay overnight - but on the other hand day trips to smaller countries like Nauru, San Marino, Andorra, Liechtenstein or Luxembourg are ok. “A ‘real’ traveler stays days or weeks in places like Lagos, Mumbai, Mongolia, Colombia…” As travelers who were previously prevented from finishing their challenge due to border closures and political unrest in specific countries in recent times are able to tick their “final” countries off, it’s likely that we’ll see the list of people who’ve traveled to every country jump up even further in 2024. For O’Reagan, this isn’t necessarily a positive thing, as “most of these tourists simply don’t have the time to travel sustainably or think about their impacts.” “Their lifestyle, if measured, would probably make a huge contribution to climate change through carbon-hungry activities,” he adds. “They do not realize this.” He goes on to point out that it’s estimated that more than 90% of people have never flown and just 1% of the world’s population is responsible for 50% of emissions from flying. Traveling to every country without flying is certainly possible, for those who have the time, money and stamina at least, as proved by Torbjørn “Thor” Pedersen who set off from Denmark to do just that back in 2013. After nearly 10 years on the move, Pedersen, who included both UN-recognized sovereign states and partially recognized states in his quest, entered his final country, the Maldives, last May. This achievement, along with that of Garfors, will likely help to inspire other travelers to attempt similar feats and/or come up with newer challenges in the coming years, with more and more competing to claim titles and/or break records. While Virtanen accepts that this is inevitable, he feels that those intent on visiting every country, as he did, should also try to find ways to help “to improve the lives of those who can´t afford” to travel. “If we can afford to fly around just for the sake of collecting countries and leaving a massive carbon footprint, then we are rich enough to afford to pay back somehow,” he adds.",https://edition.cnn.com/travel/travelers-visiting-every-country/index.html,"traveler hold unique bucket list destination many every single country world listed number people ’ able achieve

71,Why I’m going to keep teaching the truth about racism in America,"Taylor Swift won the album of the year Grammy on Sunday for her 2022 album “Midnights,” becoming the artist with the most wins in the coveted category with four. Prior to her win of the coveted award, Swift was tied with Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder and Paul Simon, who along with her all previously won album of the year three times. She took home golden gramophones for album of the year in 2009 for “Fearless,” 2015 for “1989” and 2021 for “Folklore.” After a stunned and overjoyed Swift accepted the award on Sunday from surprise presenter Celine Dion, she said, “I would love to tell you that this is the best moment in my life but I feel this happy when I finish a song or when I crack the code to a bridge that I love.” “For me the award is the work. All I want to do is keep being able to do this. I love it so much. It makes me so happy.” Swift also thanked producer Jack Antonoff, who she described as one of her “best friends” and a “once in a generation producer.” The duo collaborated on “Midnights,” and a number of Swift’s previous albums. She also thanked singer Lana Del Rey, who collaborated with Swift on “Snow on the Beach” off the album. “I think she’s a legacy artist, a legend in her prime right now,” Swift said of Del Rey. The “Style” singer is also tied with Barbra Streisand for the most all-time nominations by a female artist in the album of the year category, with six nominations total. The win caps off an already eventful night for Swift, who announced earlier in the ceremony that she’s releasing her 11th studio album “The Tortured Poets Department” in April. “Midnights” debuted to massive success in October 2022 when Swift claimed all top ten slots of the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time with tracks from the album, according to the music charting website at the time. Swift’s six Grammy nominations this year included album of the year, song of the year, record of the year, pop solo performance, pop duo/group performance and pop vocal album.

72,Mark Zuckerberg’s extraordinary apology should only be the beginning,"It’s the city that’s the main character in all your favorite TV shows and movies, the inspiration behind countless songs and art – and one of the famous destinations in the world. Perhaps it’s no wonder, then, that media company Time Out has named New York City as its best city for 2024. Time Out surveyed some 20,000 city-dwellers across the world, alongside its network of global writers and editors, to compile its latest round-up of the best cities in the globe. Factors including cities’ food scenes, architecture and cultural happenings were taken into account. The goal, says Time Out, is to provide “inspiration for travel” but also a “global snapshot of city living.” New York City’s myriad of museums and its thriving theater scene were namechecked by Time Out as reasons why the US city clinched the top spot. NYC’s global reputation also played a role – the city was ranked as the place other global city-dwellers would most like to relocate to. At number two on Time Out’s list is Cape Town, South Africa, a city ranked, according to Time Out, by “every single survey respondent” as “beautiful,” thanks no doubt to its stunning combination of sea, cityscape and spectacular mountainous surroundings. Time Out specifically shouted out Cape Town’s cultural offerings – from its late night museum evenings over the summer months to its theater and comedy offerings at Theatre on the Bay, as well as the newly opened Time Out Market Cape Town. Katy Scott, who grew up in Cape Town and now lives in France, tells CNN Travel she sees it as “perhaps the most unpretentious coastal city in the world,” praising the opportunities to get out into nature as well as the “top-rated restaurants, pristine wine farms and a swanky nightlife scene.” But Scott also points out “that these things aren’t accessible to the majority of citizens.” “South Africa may be celebrating 30 years of democracy, but the inequality in cities like Cape Town is starker than ever,” says Scott. With that in mind, Scott advises that “to truly understand the city and its people” visitors should “get out of the tourist bubble and take that trip to Robben Island or the District Six museum” – both spots recommended by Time Out that engage with South Africa’s apartheid history. “Both places offer unique and powerful insights into South Africa’s history,” Scott says. Rounding out Time Out’s top five are Berlin, Germany (praised by Time Out for its buzzy nightlife scene), London, UK (lauded for its “legendary” pubs and free museums and galleries) and Madrid, Spain (“exceptional” dining and drinking, according to Time Out). Smaller cities in the top 10 include Liverpool, UK (number 7) and Porto, Portugal (number 10).

73,The Taylor Swift AI photos offer a terrifying warning,"After feeding the collective fear of heights with “Free Solo,” climber Alex Honnold sets his sights on tackling one of the highest unclimbed cliff faces on the planet, while delivering a climate-change message for good measure. “Arctic Ascent with Alex Honnold” works on both levels (one of them really high up), while making viewers appreciate sitting on a flat, stable surface. Although sliced into three parts for consumption on National Geographic and later Disney+ and Hulu, “Arctic Ascent” is basically just a long-ish documentary, using arbitrary chapters to chronicle Honnold’s latest adventure: a 4,000-foot sea cliff in Greenland whose peak stands a full thousand feet higher than the surface he conquered at El Capitan, and seemingly more treacherous. The difference here is that getting to the climb entails a perilous trek across a desolate land mass, made worse by changing conditions brought about due to the climate crisis – an issue Honnold hopes to shed light upon with his post-“Solo” exploits, enlisting glaciologist Heidi Sevestre as part of the team joining him. Other things have changed since then too, with Honnold becoming a father, to a baby who mercifully has no idea at this point how dad spends his spare time. Honnold also strategizes with two other experienced climbers, Hazel Findlay and Mikey Schaefer, who share his enthusiasm but might not be as cavalier about the dangers associated with this particular climb, which includes having rock fragments rain down on those below. “Arctic Ascent” again showcases dizzying imagery, incorporating aerial footage of Greenland’s natural wonder while making anyone who would choose to try climbing this summit, a spellchecker’s nightmare called Ingmikortilaq – or for that matter, sleep in a tent suspended high above the ground – seem like they need their heads examined. Notably, the interactions exhibit signs of the stress these endeavors can cause, and discussions about what level of risk is acceptable. Honnold’s low-key demeanor makes him an unlikely modern-day heir to the flamboyant Evel Knievel’s daredevil legacy, but they still fall roughly within the same basket, which is to say, people who undertake extraordinary challenges for our amusement. (Granted, Honnold was doing this before “Free Solo” dramatically upped his profile, but as an executive producer of this latest project, he’s made the most out of that since.) “Arctic Ascent” inevitably lacks the sense of discovery that helped propel “Free Solo” to an Oscar; still, anyone who can watch Honnold hanging on to a vertical rock face without having their pulse quicken a little must have the equivalent of glacier-ice water in their veins. “Arctic Ascent with Alex Honnold” premieres February 4 at 8 p.m. ET on National Geographic and will stream the next day on Hulu and Disney+.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/entertainment/arctic-ascent-review-alex-honnold-free-solo/index.html,feeding collective fear height “ free solo ” climber alex honnold set sight tackling one highest unclimbed cliff face planet delivering climatechange message good measure “ arctic ascent alex honnold ” work level one really high making viewer appreciate sitting flat stable surface although sliced three part consumption national geographic later disney hulu “ arctic ascent ” basically longish documentary using arbitrary chapter chronicle honnold ’ latest adventure 4000foot sea cliff greenland whose peak stand full thousand foot higher surface conquered el capitan seemingly treacherous difference getting climb entail perilous trek across desolate land mass made worse changing condition brought due climate crisis – issue honnold hope shed light upon post “ solo ” exploit enlisting glaciologist heidi sevestre part team joining thing changed since honnold becoming father baby mercifully idea point dad spends spare time honnold also strategizes two experienced climber hazel findlay mikey schaefer share enthusiasm might cavalier danger associated particular climb includes rock fragment rain “ arctic ascent ” showcase dizzying imagery incorporating aerial footage greenland ’ natural wonder making anyone would choose try climbing summit spellchecker ’ nightmare called ingmikortilaq – matter sleep tent suspended high ground – seem like need head examined notably interaction exhibit sign stress endeavor cause discussion level risk acceptable honnold ’ lowkey demeanor make unlikely modernday heir flamboyant evel knievel ’ daredevil legacy still fall roughly within basket say people undertake extraordinary challenge amusement granted honnold “ free solo ” dramatically upped profile executive producer latest project ’ made since “ arctic ascent ” inevitably lack sense discovery helped propel “ free solo ” oscar still anyone watch honnold hanging vertical rock face without pulse quicken little must equivalent glacierice water vein “ arctic ascent alex honnold ” premiere february four eight pm et national geographic stream next day hulu disney,3
74,Why Megyn Kelly’s fake feminism is so chilling,"It’s been more than a week since the beauty looks created by makeup artist Pat McGrath for Maison Margiela’s Spring-Summer 2024 Haute Couture show captured collective imaginations, and the internet is still abuzz. The legendary creative — deemed the most influential makeup artist in the world by Vogue magazine — transformed models into living dolls, complete with porcelain skin, pencil-thin eyebrows and strikingly shaded eyes, lips and cheeks. But it was the waxen, glazed complexions she created that really stole the show, spawning countless pieces of magazine analysis and TikTok tutorials, some of which have already amassed millions of views. During an Instagram Live on Friday in which she and her team replicated a look from the Margiela show, McGrath praised much of the beauty sleuthing and fan recreations, adding that she also “saw things that kept me awake at night.” With the products used by McGrath to achieve the glistening complexions shrouded in secrecy until her live broadcast, online speculation had reached fever pitch this week. Fueled by post-show video footage of models shedding what appeared to be a second skin, some to believe that McGrath had used a peel-off mask diluted with water and airbrushed on in layers. Others claimed that the high-shine effect was created with a product from professional makeup brand Kryolan called “Liquid Glass” — a theory the internet was so taken with that it promptly sold out (and garnered a three-week-long waiting list) despite McGrath suggesting it was “amazing,” but not “the real product.” Speaking to CNN, a spokesperson for Pat McGrath Labs — the beauty brand founded by the makeup artist — appeared to confirm the face mask theory: “Pat McGrath Labs has always been centered around creating products and formulations that have never existed before, and Pat and her team had been working on one formula in the lab for some time now… Backstage for Margiela, she combined several products for the show, including face masks (one of which was cucumber) and the perfect amount of water,” they said. This technique was “the most challenging piece of the puzzle,” the spokesperson continued. “Making sure we could achieve a high-reflective glass finish without tampering with the make-up underneath. That’s where the airbrush came in. We understand that people don’t want to mix a ton of products and buy an airbrush machine. That’s why we will be dropping one product that will give you the perfect glass finish.” On Instagram Live, McGrath and her team revealed a few of the eight products used to create the airbrushed concoction, including peel-off face masks from Freeman Beauty, Proot and Que Bella. McGrath’s team sprayed seven to eight layers of the composite mask on each model, she said, a time-intensive process to ensure their glassy skin wouldn’t lose its luster before the show. A few more secrets from McGrath’s masterclass: To achieve the “porcelain foundation” look on light-skinned models, her team blended her eponymous line’s Sublime Perfection Foundation with white theatrical paint. Before airbrushing, the artists dabbed water-based special effects glue around the corners of models’ lips and noses, both for sealing and extra (extra) gloss. The models themselves also helped seal each layer of glass skin, blow-drying their faces in a process that took anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours, McGrath said. McGrath’s creations are just the latest — albeit most extreme — example of the trend for high-shine, seemingly poreless and flawless complexions with an almost wet looking sheen. Originally dubbed “glass skin,” the look is thought to have originated in Korea as early as 2013, but didn’t make its way into wider popular culture for another four years, when high profile beauty influencers began sharing the extensive skincare routines they employed to achieve it. While “glass skin” was all about leaving the face bare but with a glistening sheen, 2020s “dolphin skin” trend took things to the next level. Credited to makeup artist Mary Phillips, the aesthetic was not just about optimizing your own skin, but also layering color cosmetics with skincare to give a sleek, shiny, dolphin-just-out-the-ocean effect. Achieving it was not for the faint of heart — or the short of time. Creating “dolphin skin” requires a multi-step process involving exfoliating the skin before layering on serum, moisturizer, a hydrating mist, liquid highlighter, foundation, more highlighter, then more mist. Like “glass skin” before it, “dolphin skin” was a sensation on social media, but not everyone was a fan. In 2021, UK-based facialist and skin expert Andy Millward said the look promoted “an unrealistic expectation of what healthy skin should look like,” and added “the extreme shiny (or) wet look isn’t something we should be striving for.” Not that that stopped 2022’s shiny skin trend, popularized by model Hailey Bieber, which was then dubbed the “glazed donut” look. Celebrity makeup artist, Monika Blunder whose clients include Gemma Chan, Jessica Alba, Kate Hudson and Megan Fox, told CNN that McGrath’s “amazing” airbrushed Margiela looks were not really feasible “for every day.” However, she had suggestions “to create something similar and more wearable at home.” Prepping skin perfectly is key — she recommended starting with a face oil before applying a foundation or base, and then skipping powder to keep the shine. “After you’ve done your makeup, you can really bump up the glow by adding another thin layer of oil over the top, or for extra shine that won’t move around as much, my favorite hack is to use a clear balm as a highlighter.” Because if the legions of McGrath fans flooding social media over the past week has been anything to go by, the trend is showing no signs of losing its luster for 2024.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/style/pat-mcgrath-maison-margiela-makeup/index.html,’ week since beauty look created makeup artist pat

75,Biden wins in South Carolina and picks up first delegates of 2024,"Is your dog a small male with a long nose? Or a medium-size female with a face of average canine proportions? If so, your furry companion is more likely to be at your side for a long time, according to new research. But if yours is a pooch with a squished muzzle, the picture might be a bit less rosy. A large study published Thursday looked at data from more than 584,000 dogs across the United Kingdom and found that snout length, along with body size and sex, can influence how long a dog is likely to live. “A medium-sized, flat-faced male like a bulldog is three times more likely to live a shorter life than a small-sized, long-faced female, like a miniature dachshund or an Italian greyhound,” said Kirsten McMillan, a data scientist at Dogs Trust, the UK’s largest dog charity, and lead author of the paper in the journal Scientific Reports. The study authors examined data on 155 breeds plus mixes. While a typical Labrador retriever or border collie had a median life expectancy of just over 13 years, the researchers found that almost across the board, flat-faced, or brachycephalic, dogs fared worse by that measure. That shorter-nosed bunch included large mastiffs (9 years), beefy English bulldogs (9.3 years) and French bulldogs (9.8 years). “This paper is showing people that at a population level, these dogs are not doing well,” McMillan said. One smush-faced survivor stood out in the findings: Lhasa Apsos clocked in with one of the highest median life expectancies at 14 years. That’s up there with Shiba Inus (14.6), papillons (14.5), miniature dachshunds and Italian greyhounds (14). Most of the results fell within expected patterns. Females lived longer than males, small dogs longer than large ones. Small and medium dogs with pronounced schnozes lived over 12 years on average, while flat-faced dogs of all sizes fell short of that mark. The grim outlook may or may not come as a shock to owners of Frenchies, America’s most popular dog breed. (Last year, it unseated the Lab, which had held the title for three decades.) It’s well known that the bat-eared darlings are predisposed to a number of health issues, often owing to their flattened face shape — breathing problems, skin infections and eye trouble to name a few. Pugs and English bulldogs face these challenges, too. The Brachycephalic Working Group, a consortium of veterinary organizations, breeding associations and nonprofits in the UK, has declared “a health and welfare crisis” for flat-faced breeds. “This new research underlines these major health issues by revealing that flat-faced dogs live 1.5 years shorter lives than typical dogs,” said Dan O’Neill, an associate professor at the Royal Veterinary College in London and the working group’s chair, in a statement. “We urge anyone considering getting a flat-faced breed to ‘stop and think’ and to ensure that they acquire a dog with the best chances of a long and happy life.” Esme Wheeler, a dog welfare expert at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, concurred. “We completely understand why there is so much love out there for these breeds, but breeding bodily features which compromise the basic health and welfare of pets is wrong,” she said. “Health and welfare should always be the priority, not fashions or aesthetic trends.” Neither O’Neill nor Wheeler contributed to the research. Though limited to the UK, the results would probably be similar in the United States, especially with respect to pure breeds, since they are fairly standard around the globe, said veterinarian Dr. Silvan Urfer, an expert in dog life span at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the research. However, he posited that there might be more differences between mixes there and in the US. “It’s an excellent study that makes a very good point regarding the breeding of short-nosed dogs,” Urfer said. “I’m not at all surprised that brachycephalic breeds didn’t live as long.” One of the study’s more surprising takeaways was that purebred dogs were found to outlive mixes by about eight months. This finding doesn’t align with the commonly held notion that mixes are generally heartier and healthier than their inbred kennel club counterparts. But the current study can’t tell the whole picture, McMillan said. The data — collected from vets, breed registries, rescue organizations and pet insurance companies — divided dogs into two categories: purebred and crossbred. Within the crossbred category, the data did not distinguish between genetically diverse mutts and intentional crosses, or “designer breeds,” such as the cockapoo, labradoodle and cavachon. These are not random mixes or the products of natural selection. “We’re talking about strategically bred dogs and that has changed the game,” McMillan said. Dogs Trust is already working on a new study to determine whether these popular crosses have longer or shorter life expectancies than the breeds they’re derived from. “Designer dogs is a relatively new phenomenon, so you have a population that skews young,” Urfer said. Studying the population as it grows and ages should give better insight into the health and longevity of these burgeoning breeds. The study includes millions of data points, but it doesn’t necessarily represent the full spectrum of companion dog life, McMillan said. For instance, not everyone has pet insurance or makes regular vet visits. The research also did not account for cause of death, which is often euthanasia. “The ethical and welfare concerns surrounding dog breeding have become one of the most important issues — if not the most important issue — within canine welfare,” McMillan said. “I hope this paper is a catalyst to start policymakers, government, vets, owners, everyone asking, ‘Why are these dogs dying?’ “It will be very difficult to answer, but every time we answer even a small part of it, we are progressing towards having a much healthier canine population.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/world/dog-life-expectancy-nose-length-scn/index.html,dog small male long nose mediumsize female face average canine proportion furry companion likely side long time according new research pooch squished muzzle picture might bit le rosy large study published thursday looked data five hundred and eighty-four thousand dog across united kingdom found snout length along body size sex influence long dog likely live “ mediumsized flatfaced male like bulldog three time likely live shorter life smallsized longfaced female like miniature dachshund italian greyhound ” said kirsten mcmillan data scientist dog trust uk ’ largest dog charity lead author paper journal scientific report study author examined data one hundred and fifty-five breed plus mix typical labrador retriever border collie median life expectancy thirteen year researcher found almost across board flatfaced brachycephalic dog fared worse measure shorternosed bunch included large mastiff nine year beefy english bulldog ninety-three year french bulldog ninety-eight year “ paper showing people population level dog well ” mcmillan said one smushfaced survivor stood finding lhasa apsos clocked one highest median life expectancy fourteen year ’ shiba inus one hundred and forty-six papillon one hundred and forty-five miniature dachshund italian greyhound fourteen result fell within expected pattern female lived longer male small dog longer large one small medium dog pronounced schnoz lived twelve year average flatfaced dog size fell short mark grim outlook may may come shock owner frenchies america ’ popular dog breed last year unseated lab held title three decade ’ well known bateared darling predisposed number health issue often owing flattened face shape — breathing problem skin infection eye trouble name pug english bulldog face challenge brachycephalic working group consortium veterinary organization breeding association nonprofit uk declared “ health welfare crisis ” flatfaced breed “ new research underline major health issue revealing flatfaced dog live fifteen year shorter life typical dog ” said dan ’ neill associate professor royal veterinary college london working group ’ chair statement “ urge anyone considering getting flatfaced breed ‘ stop think ’ ensure acquire dog best chance long happy life ” esme wheeler dog welfare expert royal society prevention cruelty animal concurred “ completely understand much love breed breeding bodily feature compromise basic health welfare pet wrong ” said “ health welfare always priority fashion aesthetic trend ” neither ’ neill wheeler contributed research though limited uk result would probably similar united state especially respect pure breed since fairly standard around globe said veterinarian dr silvan urfer expert dog life span university washington involved research however posited might difference mix u “ ’ excellent study make good point regarding breeding shortnosed dog ” urfer said “ ’ surprised brachycephalic breed ’ live long ” one study ’ surprising takeaway purebred dog found outlive mix eight month finding ’ align commonly held notion mix generally heartier healthier inbred kennel club counterpart current study ’ tell whole picture mcmillan said data — collected vet breed registry rescue organization pet insurance company — divided dog two category purebred crossbred within crossbred category data distinguish genetically diverse mutt intentional cross “ designer breed ” cockapoo labradoodle cavachon random mix product natural selection “ ’ talking strategically bred dog changed game ” mcmillan said dog trust already working new study determine whether popular cross longer shorter life expectancy breed ’ derived “ designer dog relatively new phenomenon population skews young ” urfer said studying population grows age give better insight health longevity burgeoning breed study includes million data point ’ necessarily represent full spectrum companion dog life mcmillan said instance everyone pet insurance make regular vet visit research also account cause death often euthanasia “ ethical welfare concern surrounding dog breeding become one important issue — important issue — within canine welfare ” mcmillan said “ hope paper catalyst start policymakers government vet owner everyone asking ‘ dog dying ’ “ difficult answer every time answer even small part progressing towards much healthier canine population ”,8

77,Jack Smith’s prosecutors use new filing to fight back against Trump’s claims in Mar-a-Lago documents case,"Americans are living through the toughest housing market in a generation and, for some young people, the quintessential dream of owning a home is slipping away. Mortgage rates surged in recent years, hitting the highest levels in more than two decades last fall. While rates have come down slightly since then, home prices remain painfully elevated and a limited inventory of housing is still failing to keep up with demand. Such conditions mean that housing has become woefully unaffordable. Falling mortgage rates in recent weeks have helped, but home prices could remain sticky, according to economists. It’s still a cruddy time to be hunting for a home, but it’s even worse for young, first-time buyers who need to save up for a down payment and build up their credit score during a time when Baby Boomers are refusing to part with their big houses. The situation isn’t a whole lot better for renters, with rents barely coming down from record highs and half of tenants in that market saying they can’t even afford their payments. The uneasiness over America’s affordability crisis is captured clearly in surveys and polls, but data that outlines the sentiment specifically among young people is limited. CNN spoke with some young Americans about their thoughts on the current state of the US housing market and their plans for the future. Brandie Grant, 35, lives in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. Despite a difficult upbringing, she pushed herself to graduate from college with a bachelor’s degree and is now making $76,000 a year as a senior consultant for an academic publishing company, but she said she is barely making ends meet. After paying all her bills each month, including $500 to chip away at more than $90,000 in student debt, Grant said she doesn’t have enough to save for a down payment. “I’m real, real tired,” she said. “Having kids will never be on the table. I haven’t even put a cent in my retirement fund, so there is just zero hope for me to ever own a home.” The minimum down payment required to purchase a home depends on various factors, such as the type of mortgage being taken out, the prospective homebuyer’s credit score, and the property’s asking price. The conventional wisdom is that hopeful buyers should save to put down 20% before shopping around, but doing that is a pipe dream for those who can’t even save to begin with. But the typical downpayment for a first-time home buyer is usually much less: 6% last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. A government-backed Federal Housing Administration loan requires a downpayment of as little as 3.5%. But even saving up that much can be daunting. And it’s taking nine years for the typical homebuyer to save up for the median down payment on a home with the median value in the United States, according to Zillow data. Building up a down payment has also been difficult for Ross Bunton, a 26-year-old case manager living in St. Louis, Missouri, with his wife. That’s mostly due to a combination of how expensive his rent is and their costly medical bills, which eat up a significant portion of the couple’s monthly budget, he said. Their current financial situation means having kids anytime soon is out of the question, he told CNN. “I genuinely haven’t been able to save money over the past year,” Bunton said. “I don’t think that buying a house is super realistic for me even within the next couple of years, so I’m not really thinking about that right now, and if me and my wife were to have children, we would definitely want to be financially comfortable or capable of doing that. So, I also don’t see that as being realistic.” For some, living with parents is the best option, and that certainly seems to be the case nowadays with housing affordability out of reach for many young people. More than half of US adults between ages 18 and 24 lived with their parents in 2023. That’s been the reality for Corey Griffis, 24, who lives at his parents’ home in Portland, Oregon. He graduated with a master’s degree in history last year from Montana State University, but said he hasn’t had any luck finding a job. Aside from not having the financial stability of full-time employment just yet, he said he doesn’t find it possible to own a home someday unless he finds a partner first. “Having two income streams does a lot for you, and I can’t imagine owning a home until I’m partnered with somebody,” Griffis said. “The housing market is not a single person’s market.” What typically happens when a regional housing market becomes too unaffordable is that people without the means simply move somewhere cheaper, such as a suburb an hour away, for example. A less common option is moving to a completely different country. Shyahm Aguilar, 37, is a naturalized US citizen who came to the country from Mexico as a child back in the 1980s. He currently works at a hotel in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the most expensive market in the state, living in a rental single-family home with his sister and her three daughters. Aguilar said he doesn’t think owning a home in Santa Fe is “a reality in the next 10 years,” but that moving to Merida, Mexico, sometime in 2025 to start a laundromat business with his partner, who is currently working in Colorado, would probably be a much better bet. “Washers and dryers are not that expensive in Mexico, and we’ve already looked at the price to start a lavanderia [laundromat], which would be like $10,000,” Aguilar said. “I can take that money to open a business over there. Over here, that’s not even enough as a down payment for a house.” High mortgage rates are a big reason why some feel so dismayed with America’s housing market. But there’s been some good news lately. The Federal Reserve has signaled that it will soon cut interest rates now that decades-high inflation has eased off. Such a move will affect the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, though economists say they doubt rates will fall below 6% this year. The prospect of lower monthly mortgage payments has already improved Americans’ attitudes toward the housing market, according to Fannie Mae’s latest National Housing Survey, released last month. “Homeowners have told us repeatedly as of late that high mortgage rates are the top reason why it’s both a bad time to buy and sell a home, and so a more positive mortgage rate outlook may [incentivize] some to list their homes for sale, helping increase the supply of existing homes in the new year,” Mark Palim, vice president and deputy chief economist at Fannie Mae, said in a release. Still, affordability takes into account mortgage rates, family incomes and single-family home prices, which remain a vexing pain point. The 2023 median home sale price was $389,800, according to NAR, up about 1% from 2022 and the highest on record. Lower mortgage rates would improve affordability, but better zoning laws could have a more durable impact. “The sustainable solution is to make it easier to build housing. That way we can actually start heading in the right direction with affordability and have that be sustainable and not just a short-term interest rate phenomenon,” Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist, told CNN. Fairweather’s tips for young first-time buyers: Keep saving this year for when housing conditions further improve in 2025, invest some money into an index fund since the stock market is currently going strong; be realistic about what neighborhoods you should live in; and consider other more affordable housing options, such as a condominium or a townhouse. Sofiya Vyshnevska, chief operating officer at NewHomesMate, said that newly constructed homes may be a viable option for first-time buyers because some homebuilders are proposing incentives towards closing costs, such as a 2-1 buydown, which is a type of financing that lowers the interest rate for the first two years before it rises to the regular, permanent rate. Vyshnevska said those deals are becoming more common in cities that have ramped up residential construction in recent years such as Minneapolis; Houston; Dallas; Austin, Texas; Tampa, Jacksonville, and Orlando in Florida; and Atlanta and Phoenix. “Young, first-time homebuyers usually don’t know about that because there isn’t one place where they can see all of these incentives, so approaching the builder directly to make the deal work is a good option,” she said.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/economy/young-americans-giving-up-owning-a-home/index.html,"american living toughest housing

78,Pro-Trump and anti-Trump Republicans agree on one thing: He will be the nominee,"The US State Department has posted a travel advisory update urging Americans to “exercise increased caution” in the Bahamas, citing crime. “Gang-on-gang violence has resulted in a high homicide rate primarily affecting the local population,” the advisory, posted on January 26, reads. The advisory out the most-affected islands of New Providence, where Nassau is located, and Grand Bahama, where Freeport is located. “Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assaults, occur in both tourist and non-tourist areas. Be vigilant when staying at short-term vacation rental properties where private security companies do not have a presence.” The Bahamas is listed at Level 2, Exercise Increased Caution, out of 4 advisory levels. The State Department said Tuesday that the advisory level did not change in its January 26 update. Bahamas Prime Minister Phillip Edward Davis underlined the unchanged advisory level. “We remain a level 2 alongside most tourism destinations. The incidents described in the January 2024 US Embassy crime alert do not reflect general safety in The Bahamas, a country of sixteen (16) tourism destinations, and many more islands,” Davis said in a statement provided to CNN Travel on Wednesday. The Prime Minister was referring to a security alert from the US Embassy in Nassau on January 24 calling attention to 18 murders that have taken place in Nassau since the beginning of 2024. The alert cites gang violence as the primary motive, noting murders have occurred at all hours, “including in broad daylight.” “We can confirm that one person was killed on the island New Providence, and at least 18 in Nassau since the start of the year,” the State Department said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. “But the U.S. Embassy in Nassau is not aware of any U.S. citizens who have been affected.” The security alert urged people to exercise “extreme caution in the eastern part of New Providence Island (Nassau)” and also recommends being careful while driving or walking at night, not resisting robbery and other precautions. In the travel advisory updated two days later, the State Department again urges travelers not to resist any robbery attempts and cautions against opening doors to strangers. The Prime Minister’s statement said the Bahamas is implementing a crime reduction and prevention strategy and law enforcement is “taking rigorous steps to maintain our well-earned reputation, including an enhanced police presence and additional police resources (including facial recognition CCTV surveillance technology) and training.” The Bahamas isn’t the only Caribbean destination with an updated travel alert. Jamaica’s advisory was updated on January 23 to include new crime and health information. It is listed at Level 3, Reconsider Travel. While the advisory was updated, the level remained the same, the State Department said Tuesday. “Violent crimes, such as home invasions, armed robberies, sexual assaults, and homicides, are common. Sexual assaults occur frequently, including at all-inclusive resorts,” the State Department advisory for Jamaica reads. The advisory outlines specific crime risk areas in 12 of Jamaica’s 14 parishes.

79,Connecticut says it will become first state to cancel medical debt for many residents,"From the demure to the risqué, it was a night of diverse red carpet fashion at LA’s Crypto.com Arena, where the stars gathered for the 66th Grammy Awards on Sunday evening. The annual ceremony is known for producing bolder, more theatrical fashion than its Hollywood counterparts, and there were some eye-catching looks on display. Miley Cyrus turned heads with a voluminous updo and a Maison Margiela gown that appeared to be constructed entirely of gold safety pins. Triple nominee Doja Cat meanwhile arrived in a similarly revealing sheer dress by Turkish-British designer Dilara Findikoglu. Black gowns have taken center stage on many of this year’s biggest red carpets, and several attendees continued the trend at the Grammys. Among them was Janelle Monáe, in a black sequined Armani Privè outfit, and singer Caroline Polachek, who opted for a vampy vintage dress by Olivier Theyskens. But it was white, cream and ivory-colored outfits that set the tone for the evening — ranging from simple and elegant (see Olivia Rodrigo in vintage Versace) to gloriously elaborate (see Summer Walker’s outsized feathery hat, or Kat Graham’s structured Stéphane Rolland Haue Couture cape). Elsewhere, the members of Boygenius impressed in matching cream Thom Browne suits, while one of the night’s most anticipated arrivals, Taylor Swift, didn’t disappoint in a white Schiaparelli Haute Couture gown and black opera gloves.

80,Why isn’t the growing economy helping public perception of Biden?,"For anyone worried that Taylor Swift might not make it home from her overseas tour in time to see her boyfriend Travis Kelce in the Super Bowl, the Japanese Embassy has a comforting message: “Be fearless.” The diplomatic mission in Washington put out a statement Friday apparently to ease the concerns of fans fearing their idol could miss next week’s big game due to the tight timeframe. Swift is scheduled to play the Tokyo Dome in the Japanese capital from February 7 to 10, leaving her little time – given the long-haul flight and large time difference – to get back for the Super Bowl at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on February 11. Making it even more of a stretch, Swift’s final show is expected to begin at 6 p.m. and seems likely to run for about three hours, in line with her other Eras Tour dates. And that’s not to mention all the traffic she’s likely to encounter around the stadium. But if all that has you feeling worried, then just maybe you need to calm down. “Despite the 12-hour flight and 17-hour time difference, the Embassy can confidently Speak Now to say that if she departs Tokyo in the evening after her concert, she should comfortably arrive in Las Vagas before the Super Bowl begins,” the Japanese mission said in an apparent reference to the singer’s third studio album. Continuing with a reference to Swift’s second studio album, it added: “We know that many people in Japan are excited to experience Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, so we wanted to confirm that anyone concerned can be Fearless in knowing that this talented performer can wow Japanese audiences and still make it to Las Vegas to support the Chiefs.” This year, the Kansas City Chiefs, with Kelce at tight end, will go head-to-head with the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL championship game. But some viewers are likely to be as interested in the action off the pitch as that on it. Swift has been a regular at Kansas City Chiefs games since she  turned up at Kelce’s family suite in September last year to watch them against the Chicago Bears, sparking speculation that the two were dating. The pair later confirmed in separate interviews that they had already been seeing each other prior to that game. Since then, the amount of attention broadcasters have been paying the pop star in the crowd has sparked controversy among some football fans – even though it has been credited with finding a whole new audience for the game. Still, as the Japanese Embassy’s statement shows, Taylor-mania is hardly confined to the NFL or even America. In Asia, the singer sparked a ticketing frenzy after announcing that she would be playing six shows in Singapore and four in Tokyo. Tickets for the Singapore dates sold out within hours, leaving legions of “Swifties,” as her fans are known, disappointed and empty-handed. So fierce has the competition been that fans have taken to calling it the “Great War” for tickets. After her Tokyo shows – and hopefully for fans, an appearance in Vegas – Swift is expected to return overseas for seven shows in Australia.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/asia/taylor-swift-super-bowl-japanese-embassy-intl-hnk/index.html,anyone worried taylor swift might make home overseas tour time see boyfriend travis kelce super bowl japanese embassy comforting message “ fearless ” diplomatic mission washington put statement friday apparently ease concern fan fearing idol could miss next week ’ big game due tight timeframe swift scheduled play tokyo dome japanese capital february seven ten leaving little time – given longhaul flight large time difference – get back super bowl allegiant stadium la vega february eleven making even stretch swift ’ final show expected begin six pm seems likely run three hour line era tour date ’ mention traffic ’ likely encounter around stadium feeling worried maybe need calm “ despite 12hour flight 17hour time difference embassy confidently speak say departs tokyo evening concert comfortably arrive la vagas super bowl begin ” japanese mission said apparent reference singer ’ third studio album continuing reference swift ’ second studio album added “ know many people japan excited experience taylor swift ’ era tour wanted confirm anyone concerned fearless knowing talented performer wow japanese audience still make la vega support chief ” year kansa city chief kelce tight end go headtohead san francisco 49ers nfl championship game viewer likely interested action pitch swift regular kansa city chief game since turned kelce ’ family suite september last year watch chicago bear sparking speculation two dating pair later confirmed separate interview already seeing prior game since amount attention broadcaster paying pop star crowd sparked controversy among football fan – even though credited finding whole new audience game still japanese embassy ’ statement show taylormania hardly confined nfl even america asia singer sparked ticketing frenzy announcing would playing six show singapore four tokyo ticket singapore date sold within hour leaving legion “ swifties ” fan known disappointed emptyhanded fierce competition fan taken calling “ great war ” ticket tokyo show – hopefully fan appearance vega – swift expected return overseas seven show australia,0
81,How long will your dog live? Measure its nose,"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) descended on a London bar earlier this month to make a historic announcement: for the first time, the Olympics would be partnering with a beer company. In a room crowded with people in suits, the sponsorship deal with brewing giant AB InBev was met with beaming smiles and the clinking of beer bottles by many of those in attendance. At the same time, IOC President Thomas Bach gushed about how sports and beer belong together. “This partnership, from our perspective, is a perfect match,” Bach said during the announcement event, during which he talked about celebrating “the joy of sport and the joy of life.” Amid all that talk of sport and life, the IOC and AB InBev were keen to underline that their sponsorship deal is being led by an alcohol-free beer, Corona Cero. The exception is in the US during the LA 2028 Games, when Michelob ULTRA will front the partnership. But not everyone has welcomed news of the partnership – which covers the next three Olympics and Paralympics in Paris, Milan-Cortina d’Ampezzo and Los Angeles – with such enthusiasm. Notably, campaign groups have pointed to the incongruity of an event like the Olympics – perhaps the world’s biggest sporting event – rubbing shoulders with a beer company. “Alcohol and the Olympics is certainly an odd pairing, given the athletes competing at this top level often do not drink alcohol at all as they prepare to take part in the Games,” Andrew Misell, a director at Alcohol Change UK, said in a statement sent to CNN Sport. The last Summer Olympics in Tokyo was watched by more than three billion people, according to the IOC, and sponsoring such an event has become something of a holy grail for major brands. AB InBev is the latest company to participate in The Olympic Partner (TOP) program – the highest level of Olympic sponsorship – alongside the likes of Coca-Cola, Visa and Deloitte. For beer companies, in particular, sports are a fruitful market. A 2018 report from marketing service Sportcal found that there were 281 active sports sponsorship deals with the world’s 30 top alcohol brands, worth an estimated total of $764.5 million. AB InBev said that it would not reveal the cost of its deal with the IOC. Within the public health community, there have been efforts to restrict alcohol marketing, which is described as a “poorly regulated” sector in the World Health Organization’s global alcohol action plan for 2022-2030. WHO also runs an initiative to reduce alcohol harm around the world, including advocating for bans and tighter regulations on alcohol advertising, sponsorship and promotion. The harmful impact of excessive alcohol consumption is now well-established, from increasing health risks – including cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease and depression – to physical and sexual violence to fatal traffic accidents. In 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 13% of adult men and 9% of women had an alcohol use disorder in the US. “We know that alcohol marketing works, and that consumers are very aware of brands and branding strategies from an early age,” Amandine Garde, a professor of law at the University of Liverpool whose work has focused on protecting public health, told CNN Sport. “There is a lot of research on this point. Marketing influences consumer preferences and purchases, and therefore their health.” The IOC and AB InBev see the deal as part of a wider market demand for non-alcoholic drinks which, despite being in circulation for decades, have had a recent surge in popularity. In the year ending May 14, 2022, US retail sales of non-alcoholic beer rose 21% to $316 million, according to NielsenIQ, and brewing companies like AB InBev, Heineken and Molson Coors have started to expand their zero alcohol offerings. “Part of this partnership involves strengthening beer as a category of moderation so that consumers can safely and responsibly enjoy the Olympic Games with non-alc beer,” Marcel Marcondes, chief marketing officer at AB InBev, told CNN Sport. “Corona Cero leads the way in that direction. This is going to be a central part of our activation.” Marcondes added that moderation is an “extremely important” part of AB InBev’s messaging, explaining how non-alcoholic drinks “open up new occasions and new opportunities for people to drink beer.” In announcing the partnership with AB InBev last month, Bach said that that the focus on Corona Cero reflects a “commitment to social responsibility, to a healthy lifestyle” – though not everyone is convinced by that messaging. “I find this eminently cynical that the IOC has concluded this deal and endorses the industry playbook of ‘responsible consumption’ when we know that alcohol consumption is harmful per se,” said Garde. CNN has contacted the IOC for further comment. While growing in popularity, non-alcoholic drinks do still occupy only a small share of the market compared to regular alcoholic beverages, and campaign groups remain sceptical of whether they are a positive influence when it comes to public health. “I think the jury’s still out on the balance between helping people who are trying to drink less or give up, versus the risks of advertising a no or low preparation as an entry to young people and to increase familiarity with it,” Ian Gilmore, founder and chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, told CNN Sport. How these drinks are marketed to consumers is also seen as significant, particularly given the visual similarities between alcoholic drinks and their no-alcohol counterparts. “Corona Cero, or the zero-alcohol version of Corona, shares key features with the Corona brand,” Alex Barker, a lecturer in psychology at the University of Derby, told CNN Sport. “The question is whether the audience will know that this is for a zero-alcohol brand, or whether they will just see Corona and assume that it’s for Corona. This could be acting as an alibi brand.” Barker added, “We know that exposure to alcohol marketing leads to more drinking in people who already drink, or alcohol initiation in younger people as well. And I think the concern here is that this is going to inadvertently advertise an alcohol brand.” The Olympics doesn’t permit any advertising in and around venues during the Games, and France’s strict advertising laws might also limit how visible any alcohol-related branding is during this year’s event, which is being held in Paris. Under “La Loi Evin” (Evin’s Law), alcohol sponsorships are banned at sporting events, including when they are being televised, and the content of permitted advertisements on billboards, for example, is closely controlled. The law also prohibits the sale of alcohol at sports venues unless a temporary exemption has been granted, though local organizers do not plan to apply for an exemption for this year’s Olympics. Only VIPs, therefore, will be able to drink alcohol at venues and not the average spectator. Some brands have found ways to navigate France’s restrictive laws when it comes to alcohol advertising. During rugby’s Six Nations Championship, which is sponsored by Guinness, the name of the drink was replaced by the word “greatness” in the brand’s recognizable font and colors for matches held at the Stade de France. “La Loi Evin” only applies to beverages with an alcohol content by volume of more than 1.2%. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that non-alcoholic drinks like Corona Cero are entirely excluded from the remit of the act, according to Garde. “The limits imposed on alcohol advertising cover both direct and indirect advertising, and the notion of ‘indirect advertising’ has been interpreted broadly by the courts,” she told CNN Sport. “It is, in my view, arguable that the use of similar branding for alcoholic and no-lo beverages is specifically intended to draw attention to the brand in its entirety, and the brand is primarily known for its alcoholic beverages.” The IOC has previously come under pressure for having sponsors linked with unhealthy lifestyles, notably McDonald’s and Coca-Cola. The former ended its Olympic partnership by mutual agreement in 2017, while Coca-Cola has been supporting the Games since 1928. With 30% of its funding coming from TOP marketing rights, the IOC clearly needs sponsorships to survive. But for Garde, striking a deal with a beer company remains a regrettable decision. “It flies in the face of the commitments that states have made, individually and collectively, to prevent and address alcohol-related harm,” she said. “This is yet again an example of the prioritization of short-term profits over people’s health.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/01/31/sport/olympics-ab-inbev-beer-spt-intl/index.html,"international olympic committee ioc descended london bar earlier month make historic announcement first

82,Interested in the new weight loss drugs? Here are 5 things to know,"(CNN) — Being on a diet sometimes feels like an American pastime: If you haven’t experienced the “pleasure” of it, then it’s almost certain that your BFF, baby brother, aunt or someone else in your close circle of family and friends has. It’s probably no coincidence that government statistics show that more than 30% of Americans are overweight and more than 42% have obesity. A related government survey found that almost half of US adults said they have tried to lose weight in the last 12-month period. The top two methods were exercising and eating less food, followed by consuming more fruits, vegetables and salads. People want to lose weight to look a certain way “now,” and they also want to live longer and healthier lives, with a lower risk of developing serious health conditions in the future. But anyone who has ever dieted can tell you that losing weight is hard and that long-term weight loss requires sustained effort, which can sometimes feel Herculean, even impossible. A new class of medications — called glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s — has taken the country by storm because these drugs seem to make weight loss more effortless. They often quiet the “food noise,” or brain chatter about food, that makes it so hard to stick to those all-important lifestyle changes. Their brand names have become household words, seemingly overnight. Ozempic and Wegovy have semaglutide as the active ingredient, while Mounjaro and Zepbound contain tirzepatide. The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta unpacks the ins and the outs of these new medications to give listeners a crash course on what they are all about. You can listen below. Originally developed for type 2 diabetes, medications such as semaglutide and tirzepatide work by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide 1, which is released in our gut when we eat. “It’s a peptide that is secreted by our intestine, and it’s normally very short-acting, and it’s degraded by other enzymes in the body really quickly,” obesity specialist Dr. Jorge Moreno told CNN Chief Medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta on the Chasing Life podcast recently. Moreno, an assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, treats patients looking to manage their weight. He explained that GLP-1 is a nutrient-stimulated hormone that activates when you eat, telling your body you just had food. “(It goes) into the area of the brain that is the hypothalamus … and (it tells) your brain, ‘You’ve had food, stop eating,’” he said. The medications attach to the same receptors as the GLP-1 hormone but are longer-acting. “And so, they keep this mechanism working consistently,” Moreno said. “They basically decrease your appetite by signaling in the hypothalamus that you’re full.” Both the hormone and the medications also trigger other actions, such as slowing down the movement of food through the gut and telling the body to release more insulin. Tirzepatide also can attach to the receptors of another related hormone, called GIP for short, which makes it a bit more powerful. If you are considering starting one of these medications, Moreno recommends keeping these five facts in mind. At the moment, the weight loss versions of semaglutide (Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Zepbound) are approved to treat people with obesity, not those looking to shed a few pounds. “Patients should be aware that these are treatments for a chronic medical condition known as obesity,” Moreno said. “I think it’s important to realize that obesity is a chronic disease that is relapsing (and) that requires long-term treatment.” He said that Wegovy and Zepbound are — in the parlance of the US Food and Drug Administration — “indicated” for use in people diagnosed with obesity, or those with a body mass index of 30 and above. They’re also indicated for people with a BMI of 27 and above who also have a weight-related medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure. (Semaglutide, sold as Ozempic, and tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro, are indicated only for people with type 2 diabetes.) If you haven’t been given one of these diagnoses, you may have trouble getting a prescription, let alone getting your health insurance to cover the hefty price tag. These drugs are pretty effective in helping many people lose weight. They are filling a gap between earlier weight loss drugs, which Moreno said help people lose on average between 5% and 10% of their body weight, and bariatric surgery, an invasive procedure that he said helps people lose on average around 25% to 30%. “It’s important to know that these medications are efficacious,” Moreno said. “On average, with semaglutide, the weight loss average can be close to 15%. Tirzepatide is reaching bariatric surgery levels of weight loss, with a weight loss close to 21%.” This class of drugs — GLP-1 receptor agonists — has been used since 2005 to treat diabetes, so it has a relatively long track record for safety. “It’s also important to understand that these are safe medications,” Moreno said. “Yes, like any other medication, these medications have side effects. Most commonly in the patients I see (are) nausea, constipation and acid reflux — we call it GERD. “Now, rare side effects — and by rare I mean less than 1% of the time — include things like pancreatitis, which is … inflammation of your pancreas — extremely rare,” he said. But he added that as these drugs grow in popularity, “a rare event becomes a little bit more obvious, because there (are) more people using these medications.” Like any chronic disease, treatment requires a partnership with your doctor. “Just like diabetes, just like hypertension, obesity management requires close follow-up. This is not a one-and-done conversation with your doctor,” Moreno said. He recommended following up every month or every other month. “You need to advocate for yourself,” he said. “You should definitely be followed closely, because this is a long-term strategy to help you.” “One medication is not going to fix everything. One medication is not going to be ‘it,’” Moreno said, noting that these drugs are just one component of a comprehensive plan to treat obesity. “Lifestyle is still important,” he said. “This is the time to start exercising.

83,Do you know the leading cause of death in the US? How to reduce your odds,"(CNN) — What if you were able to have your favorite song basically on speed dial, ready to go for any moment that calls for it? What’s known as a “Spotify tattoo” has made that possible: On Spotify, every piece of content has a series of unique sound bars known as a Spotify code, meant for sharing the content with someone when scanned with the camera function on Spotify’s mobile app. Get a code tattooed on your arm or another body part and, when scanned, it should immediately play the content associated with it. (That is, when the tattoo has been done well, and especially when it’s fresh. The Wall Street Journal, for example, has interviewed several people who reported their tattoos were no longer working once both the body art and their skin had started to age.) Spotify launched its codes in 2017. Exactly when the tattoo fad began isn’t clear, but on TikTok, videos tagged “#spotifytattoo” have garnered 14.8 million views. Ten million of these were on a viral clip of a UK-based tattoo artist showing off the results of a Spotify tat on his friend’s forearm — it played the friend’s wedding song, “A Thousand Years” by Christina Perri, to their delight. In the last few years, at least a few hundred people have also gone under the needle to pay permanent tribute to their favorite tunes, showing off their musical ink on TikTok or Instagram. “We love seeing listeners wear the audio they love on their sleeves and helping them rep their fandom,” Spotify told The Wall Street Journal in a statement. CNN has reached out to the company for additional comment. Tattooing the codes can be stressful, especially in that moment of truth between finishing the piece and testing whether it works, said tattoo artist John Lapides of United Tattoo in Fountain, Colorado. Lapides has inked two Spotify tattoos: One connected to the Michael Bublé song “Everything” in November 2022, and another in December of that year for “Gone Away” by the band The Offspring. “I told them, ‘If it is scannable, fantastic. If it’s not scannable, I’m sorry, but that’s part of the risk,’” Lapides said. “Lo and behold, when we finished it was scannable.” Reasons why people get these tattoos run the gamut: Some people simply want the fun party trick of flashing a phone at their arm to play Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up,” while others have more sentimental motivations. The song choice of Lapides’ first Spotify code customer was related to a memory of their father who passed away, he remembered. The customer shared that the tattoo “almost brought their dad back around,” Lapides said, “because now they’re able to listen to the song and always have it.” Other times, it’s simply a means of decorating the body, said Drew Hibbard, a tattoo artist and piercer at Blue Lotus Tattoo & The Piercing Lounge in Madison, Wisconsin. Hibbard has applied one Spotify tattoo. “Life is short,” he added. “I’ve definitely fallen victim to getting quirky, fun tattoos just for the hell of it … Each one of my tattoos are like a time stamp for a part of my life.” In conversations with CNN, Lapides and Hibbard discussed what to know if you’re considering having a favorite song immortalized on your body. These conversations have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. John Lapides: Prior to the actual tattooing process, I’d take a picture of the code and, like I would for any other tattoo, print it out on a machine that had ink on the back of the page so I could transfer the design from the paper to the skin. That helps me know that all my straight lines were straight, all my parallel lines were parallel, and all my circles were circular. I just follow those purple stencil lines with the tattoo machine as closely as possible, and then do the shading on top. Lapides: Make sure the tattoo is done on a flatter body part so the camera can read it as easily as possible with as little distortion as possible — I’m sure if it’s in some way rolling off the side of your arm, it will be harder to scan. Both tattoos I did were done on forearms, one was closer to the wrist and the other to the elbow. Drew Hibbard: You don’t want it on your hands or feet because they don’t hold ink well and they’re always being used. Lapides: Line weight and line thickness also play a huge role. The lines (in a Spotify code) vary in height, and if one of those lines is not straight or not symmetrical on the top and bottom ends, or on the left and right, the tattoo might not be readable. It’s also good to have the lines be a little thinner than needed at first, because if it doesn’t work, you can thicken them — but you can’t take away thickness. And as time goes on, those lines will get a bit thicker (as skin stretches, ages or loses elasticity). You need to have gaps in between that are going to always stay gaps. Also, the tattoo doesn’t necessarily need the three lines within that little circular Spotify logo, but it does need the circle. Hibbard: Spotify tattoos are a super cute and meaningful idea, but years down the road, who knows if Spotify will even be a thing? Also, companies are always upgrading what they’re doing — who knows if they’ll switch to a QR code like everybody else. Lapides: I’m not sure if these will be scannable 10 to 20 years from now. People lose weight, gain weight or get pregnant. But I’ve hopefully given them the best chance of being scannable by leaving gaps or space for the tattoo to expand and age. Hibbard: That’s why you should also pick a size that will age well — doing a 4- or 5-inch tattoo leaves a lot more room than a 2-inch one. And doing the correct instructed aftercare also helps. Always moisturize. Lapides: Studios’ websites and Instagrams are helpful resources; you can also find a reputable studio by good reviews or word of mouth. You can go to the shop as well to get a sense of their professionalism and respect for your input. But not everyone in a reputable studio is created equal. Artists who do fine line, traditional, geometric or black-work styles — which revolve around very clean line work — are good choices, but a watercolor tattoo artist might not do the cleanest piece.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/style/spotify-tattoo-trend-risks-tips-wellness/index.html,cnn — able favorite song basically speed dial ready go moment call ’ known “ spotify tattoo ” made possible spotify every piece content series unique sound bar known spotify code meant sharing content someone scanned camera function spotify ’ mobile app get code tattooed arm another body part scanned immediately play content associated tattoo done well especially ’ fresh wall street journal example interviewed several people reported tattoo longer working body art skin started age spotify launched code two thousand and seventeen exactly tattoo fad began ’ clear tiktok video tagged “ spotifytattoo ” garnered one hundred and forty-eight million view ten million viral clip ukbased tattoo artist showing result spotify tat friend ’ forearm — played friend ’ wedding song “ thousand year ” christina perri delight last year least hundred people also gone needle pay permanent tribute favorite tune showing musical ink tiktok instagram “ love seeing listener wear audio love sleeve helping rep fandom ” spotify told wall street journal statement cnn reached company additional comment tattooing code stressful especially moment truth finishing piece testing whether work said tattoo artist john lapides united tattoo fountain colorado lapides inked two spotify tattoo one connected michael bublé song “ everything ” november two thousand and twenty-two another december year “ gone away ” band offspring “ told ‘ scannable fantastic ’ scannable ’ sorry ’ part risk ’ ” lapides said “ lo behold finished scannable ” reason people get tattoo run gamut people simply want fun party trick flashing phone arm play rick astley ’ “ never gon na give ” others sentimental motivation song choice lapides ’ first spotify code customer related memory father passed away remembered customer shared tattoo “ almost brought dad back around ” lapides said “ ’ able listen song always ” time ’ simply mean decorating body said drew hibbard tattoo artist piercer blue lotus tattoo piercing lounge madison wisconsin hibbard applied one spotify tattoo “ life short ” added “ ’ definitely fallen victim getting quirky fun tattoo hell … one tattoo like time stamp part life ” conversation cnn lapides hibbard discussed know ’ considering favorite song immortalized body conversation lightly edited condensed clarity john lapides prior actual tattooing process ’ take picture code like would tattoo print machine ink back page could transfer design paper skin help know straight line straight parallel line parallel circle circular follow purple stencil line tattoo machine closely possible shading top lapides make sure tattoo done flatter body part camera read easily possible little distortion possible — ’ sure ’ way rolling side arm harder scan tattoo done forearm one closer wrist elbow drew hibbard ’ want hand foot ’ hold ink well ’ always used lapides line weight line thickness also play huge role line spotify code vary height one line straight symmetrical top bottom end left right tattoo might readable ’ also good line little thinner needed first ’ work thicken — ’ take away thickness time go line get bit thicker skin stretch age loses elasticity need gap going always stay gap also tattoo ’ necessarily need three line within little circular spotify logo need circle hibbard spotify tattoo super cute meaningful idea year road know spotify even thing also company always upgrading ’ — know ’ switch qr code like everybody else lapides ’ sure scannable ten twenty year people lose weight gain weight get pregnant ’ hopefully given best chance scannable leaving gap space tattoo expand age hibbard ’ also pick size age well — four 5inch tattoo leaf lot room 2inch one correct instructed aftercare also help always moisturize lapides studio ’ website instagrams helpful resource also find reputable studio good review word mouth go shop well get sense professionalism respect input everyone reputable studio created equal artist fine line traditional geometric blackwork style — revolve around clean line work — good choice watercolor tattoo artist might cleanest piece,2
84,"The animals you can count on to predict weather, according to science","“It’s not true that life is one damn thing after another – it’s one damn thing over and over.” — Edna St. Vincent Millay I’ve seen the 1993 film “Groundhog Day” again and again and again, but only once on the big screen, a few years after it was in theaters. It was shown in a packed lecture hall inside Baltimore’s Walters Art Museum, followed by a lecture from a comparative religion scholar who took us through the spiritual meaning and symbolism cleverly packaged in what, on its surface, is a rom-com with a “Twilight Zone” premise. Even if you haven’t seen the film you still know the basic plot because the term “Groundhog Day” has entered the common vernacular – which alone speaks to its resonance beyond the film itself – as shorthand for repeating the same experience over and over. But it’s worth seeing, for the first time or the tenth, to witness self-centered weatherman Phil Connors (a role only Bill Murray could master) breaking that cycle through personal redemption. It’s a grand metaphor some scholars see as Buddhist, Christian or secularly philosophical. It’s also directly, practically applicable to how you spend your day today, and everyday. I think the film is best described as “Buddish,” an adjective coined by the film’s director, Harold Ramis, to sum up his own belief system. His mother-in-law and one of his best friends were devout Zen Buddhists who hooked him onto its precepts. “Memorable, simple, didn’t require articles of faith, but completely humanistic in every way that I valued,” he said in an interview for Chicago magazine in 2008. “So I proselytize it without practicing it.” And what an entertaining Buddish proselytization “Groundhog Day” is. Like sushi or a Jamba Juice shake, it’s so delicious you barely realize you’re eating raw fish and fruit. That’s the reason for this metaphysical movie’s enduring cult status: a genuinely hilarious film that glimpses the meaning of life. There are many theories about Phil’s temporal loop (which by one estimate lasted nearly 34 years) and his eventual escape. One sees it as a metaphor for psychotherapy: repeating the stories of one’s past until you have a breakthrough that allows you to dismantle old patterns. Another claims it illustrates a classic economic paradigm. But the most wisdom-invoking evidence amounts to religious insight and how to most fruitfully spend our precious hours. One of the central tenets of Buddhism is that we must continue to reincarnate until we find enlightenment. The concept, called samsara, keeps us living out many lives through “various modes of existence” (called gati), some lowly animals and others god-like, as determined by your actions (karma). Once ignorance and ego are destroyed by your actions and awareness, you awaken to the true, interconnected reality, which frees you from the cycle and into heavenly nirvana. In the film – written by Danny Rubin, a Zen Buddhist, according to Ramis’ DVD commentary of the film —  Phil reincarnates each day, but he also transforms his behavior over “time.” He takes self-centered advantage of his unique predicament – robbing bank trucks, stuffing his face with angel food cake, tricking a woman into bed —  but eventually perfects the day with creative self-improvement tasks and compassionately helping others. Once he becomes the best possible version of Phil Connors, he is released from his temporal prison, while simultaneously winning the love of his virtuous producer, Rita. Phil’s plight is not unlike a character from Greek mythology who was doomed to eternally and perpetually push a boulder up a mountain. In his essay “The Myth of Sisyphus,” Albert Camus uses the story to illustrate the absurdity of lives that toil away at meaningless jobs. But Camus says we must find hope, and therefore meaning, in such a plight and he imagines Sisyphus understanding and accepting it. There’s a similar Buddhist tale of an enlightened monk who climbs a mountain to get a spoonful of snow in order to fill a well at the bottom of the mountain, again and again. Some lessons take a long and seemingly futile amount of time to learn. Buddhist monasticism is itself “Groundhog”-like with the same routine, clothes and daily rituals —  for decades of practice. Yet every moment is still different. Remember what the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus said: “No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it’s not the same river and he’s not the same man.” In that sense, Phil doesn’t repeat the same day over and over because one significant thing is different each Groundhog Day: him. He is the one thing that is changing. What is time anyway? Illusory, says Buddhist dogma, a notion contained in the Zen koan Phil asks as he begins to understand that his own time is not progressing: “What if there is no tomorrow? There wasn’t one today.” That’s right, woodchuck-chuckers, there is no past or future. There is only now. The Catholic concept of purgatory, a spiritual realm where souls must linger until they expiate their remaining sins and earn their way into heaven, fits the film’s bill as much as the Buddhist concept samsara. And many references and motifs that recur in the film support the notion that “Groundhog Day” is Christian rather than Buddhist. “These sticky buns are heaven.” “When you stand in the snow you look like an angel.” The groundhog hibernation —  rebirth after a death of sorts, and emerging from the sleepy tomb —  is reminiscent of Jesus. There’s even a delightfully blasphemous scene in which Phil declares that he is a god. “I’m not the God … I don’t think,” he wonders aloud as he contemplates how close he comes to the Catholic conception of monotheism. “Maybe he’s not omnipotent. He’s just been around so long he knows everything.” This after he has shouted, like an angry deity, “I make the weather!” Then there’s the film’s montage with a homeless man whom Phil brushes off early on, patting his pants pockets like he doesn’t have any cash. Later Phil tries to help repeatedly, only to find the man dies every time. It’s the lesson of the Serenity Prayer, written by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and later co-opted by Alcoholics Anonymous: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference. After accepting that he cannot save the old man, Phil turns an optimistic and meaningful corner in the plot and begins living in service to others (catching a falling boy from a tree, saving the mayor from choking etc). It’s this change of direction that allows him to escape purgatory. Whatever spiritual takeaway the film holds for you, it’s an undeniable call for hope. Phil survives his many attempts at suicide – leaping from a church, dropping a toaster in the tub, driving off a cliff – and is reborn a hopeful, charitable man. Baptized by death and stronger for it on the other side, he tells his television audience: “When Chekhov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life.” Winter is such a great metaphor for the bleakness that precedes rebirth. “I’ll give you a winter prediction,” the weatherman reports in the “hopeless” second act of the film. “It’s gonna be cold, it’s gonna be gray, and it’s gonna last you for the rest of your life.” But in a more optimistic stage he wakes up one happy morning and surprises a stranger with a hug and a Samuel Coleridge quote: “Winter, slumbering in the open air, wears on its smiling face a dream…of spring.” It’s from the sonnet “Work Without Hope” which contains the famous line “bloom for whom ye may,” which Phil does. This is the classic hero’s journey. Phil is exiled into an unexpected adventure, despairs, suffers losses, but eventually learns how to overcome his obstacles and hopelessness. By the end of the film, he has managed to become the town hero for all the mitzvah he crams into a single day. You don’t have to subscribe to Buddhism or Christianity or believe in reincarnation or heaven for this story to be directly applicable to your daily life. “What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?” Phil asks a townie, Ralph, in the film. “That about sums it up for me,” says Ralph. And who doesn’t relate, at one time or another, for one day, or many years, to that sentiment. It’s Thoreau’s “life of quiet desperation.” It’s Sisyphus. It’s George Bailey pre-epiphany in “It’s a Wonderful Life.” “I think people place too much emphasis on their careers,” Phil says to Rita. “I wish we could all live in the mountains, at high altitude. That’s where I see myself in five years. How about you?” This sentiment echoes an earlier role in Murray’s career as Larry Darrell in the movie, based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, “The Razor’s Edge.” Darrell takes a pilgrimage to find enlightenment with Tibetan monks high in the Himalayas where he observes that, “It’s easy to be a holy man on top of a mountain.” The rest of us are down here in the valley, where it’s harder. Each day is not that different than the last. We’re on autopilot sometimes. We’re bored. We repeat our bad habits. We are often self-centered and usually under-inspired. But something does change every day, even if it’s imperceptible. It’s ourselves. And we can choose how this day will unfold, and how we will slowly evolve. There might even be a “Groundhog Day”-inspired resolution: memorizing French poetry, playing the piano, figuring out how to help others more often. Like Phil, we can utilize creativity and compassion to change a glass-is-half-empty paradigm, to half full. The pursuit of meaning is itself meaningful. And today, as well as everyday, can be your first day of spring.",https://edition.cnn.com/2016/02/01/health/groundhog-day-movie-wisdom-project/index.html,"“ ’ true life one damn thing another – ’ one

85,Bones found in pit may ‘fundamentally change’ human history in Europe,"Patrick Mahomes can do almost anything. From throwing tight spirals at any angle to any location on the NFL field to winning Super Bowl and MVP titles, the world is his oyster. One thing though that he hasn’t been able to do as of yet is develop the eye-popping muscles some of his football contemporaries have. And that was rammed home to Mahomes after a post from the official NFL Instagram from the Kansas City Chiefs’ locker room following their victory over the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game showed a topless Mahomes speaking to his teammates. The 28-year-old’s unassuming physique – a sharp contradiction to his other-worldly abilities with the ball in his hands – was the subject of fun on social media, so much so that Mahomes himself commented on it. “Yoooo why they have to do me like that!?!?!? #DadBodSZN,” he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. Now, Mahomes’ dad, Pat Mahomes, admits he has to take some credit for it, while also backing up his son’s work ethic. “Patrick works really hard, he’s at the gym all the time, he works out three times a week,” said on “CNN This Morning” on Thursday. “He’s unfortunate, he got that from me too, that’s in his DNA. “We just don’t get the muscles like DK Metcalf and some of the guys who are built likes rocks and statues. We’ve just got this natural ‘dad bod’ and, hey, we’re representing.” Pat Mahomes knows what it’s like to compete as a professional athlete: the two-time NFL MVP’s dad is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who had stints across the US and in Japan during his time as a player. So when it came to raising a son who showed promise as an athlete from early on, he was uniquely placed to provide an appropriate guiding hand. The 53-year-old describes Mahomes’ sporting abilities at a young age as “special.” “The things he was doing at such a young age, I knew that was different. I knew that was special and I knew that if he continued to move in that fashion and to continue working every day that he’d have a chance to be a professional athlete,” Mahomes Sr. said. “I mean, I’ve never seen a kid that worked as hard as he did, that grinded every day to try to make himself better, like he says, each and every day. It was just crazy. We would be out just shooting baskets at 10 to 11 p.m. at night and I would tell him: ‘Ain’t nobody out here working but me, you and Michael Jordan. We’re the only three guys that are working and trying to get better.’ And he took it and he ran with it and for him to get to the pinnacle of where he is now is just outstanding.” All that hard work has clearly paid off, with Mahomes’ unique skillset pushing the Chiefs to new heights and turning himself into the face of the NFL since Tom Brady’s retirement. On February 11, his Chiefs will face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII in Las Vegas, Nevada – the fourth time the team has reached the season-ending game of the NFL season since the native Texan became a starter. It’s been a remarkable run with Mahomes at the helm for Kansas City, with himself, head coach Andy Reid and Travis Kelce forming an almost unstoppable combination. And for Mahomes Sr., who says he will be attendance in Las Vegas to see if his son can win his third Super Bowl ring, it’s quite the experience seeing his son achieve all he has so far. “To compete at the highest level is something that is rare and very special.

86,‘Mind-blowing’ new images reveal 19 galaxies ‘down to the smallest scales ever observed’,"Former President Donald Trump repeated a variety of his previous false claims about the Middle East, rival Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other subjects in an interview that aired Sunday morning on Fox News – notably including his years-old lie that he warned the US not to invade Iraq. Here’s a non-comprehensive roundup. Trump revived a lie he has been uttering since his 2016 presidential campaign – an assertion that he publicly spoke out against the idea of invading Iraq. He said on Fox: “Going into Iraq was a stupid thing. Remember I used to say: ‘Don’t do it, but if you do it, keep the oil.’” Facts First: Trump’s claim that he said “Don’t do it” is false; the claim was debunked eight years ago. In reality, Trump did not publicly express opposition to the March 2003 invasion of Iraq before it occurred. In his 2000 book, “The America We Deserve,” Trump argued a military strike on Iraq might be necessary; when radio host Howard Stern asked Trump in September 2002 whether he is “for invading Iraq,” Trump responded, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly”; and Trump did not express a firm opinion about the looming war in a Fox interview in January 2003, saying that “either you attack or don’t attack” and that then-President George W. Bush “has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps.” Trump began criticizing the war in 2003, but after the invasion, and also said that year that American troops should not be withdrawn from Iraq. He emerged as an explicit opponent of the war in 2004. You can read more here about his shifting positions. A CNN search in 2019 turned up no examples of Trump saying anything before the war about keeping Iraq’s oil. Trump’s White House did not respond at the time to our request to provide any such evidence. Trump repeated a claim he has made at various campaign events in recent months, saying Iran intentionally avoided hitting a base that housed US troops in Iraq when it launched missiles toward the base in January 2020 in retaliation for the Trump-ordered assassination of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Trump claimed on Fox, as he has before, that Iran “called me” to let him know of its plan to deliberately miss. He said, “We knew they weren’t going to hit inside the fort” even though outside observers were left wondering, “How come they all missed?” Facts First: Trump’s claims that all of Iran’s missiles missed the base are false. As The Washington Post noted in its own fact check late last year, 11 Iranian missiles hit the al-Asad base Iran targeted in the retaliatory attack. The fact that missiles hit the base was confirmed by satellite images, by the Pentagon, and by a CNN visit to the base days after the attack. CNN reported from the scene: “Ten of the 11 missiles struck US positions at the sprawling desert Iraqi airbase. One struck a remote location on the Iraqi military’s side.” CNN reported that “the Iranian missiles, which used on-board guidance systems, managed to shred sensitive US military sites, damaging a special forces compound, and two hangars, in addition to the US drone operators’ housing unit.” While no US troops were killed, more than 100 were diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injuries. Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, told reporters he believed Iran’s intent was to kill; he credited “the defensive techniques that our forces used” for the absence of deaths. Trump has provided no substantiation for the claim that Iran called him to telegraph the strike and offer reassurance. As The Post reported, Iraq’s prime minister said he received a general warning from Iran that it was about to begin its response and target US troops. Trump said the New Hampshire primary he won in January was the one place that Haley had a chance to win – claiming that this is “because Democrats are stupidly allowed to vote in the Republican primary, and independents also.” Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Registered Democrats aren’t allowed to vote in New Hampshire’s Republican primary. Only registered Republicans and independents are allowed to vote. Some independents who lean toward Democrats almost certainly participated in the Republican primary, plus some Democrats who switched their affiliation to independent before the early October deadline. But Trump claimed, with no caveats, that Democrats are simply allowed to vote in New Hampshire. That’s not true. (And it is standard for states to allow people to switch affiliations by a certain date to participate in another party’s primary.) Trump claimed of Haley: “We have a situation where they forgot to apply, I guess, for Indiana. You don’t run and not apply for Indiana. Great state.” Facts First: This is false. Haley did not forget to apply to be on the Republican primary ballot in Indiana. The filing deadline for the May 7 primary, February 9, has not arrived yet. Trump has previously made a different claim that Haley did not submit enough signatures by the state’s January 30 signature deadline to qualify for the ballot; Haley’s campaign told CNN and other media outlets that this is not true and that she submitted more than enough signatures. Regardless, the campaign didn’t forget to apply. “We’ll be on the ballot. We turned in more than double all the signatures required and they are being verified now as part of the process before the filing deadline on February 9,” Haley campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a Sunday email. In response to a similar claim from Trump, Haley wrote on social media on Friday: “Looks like he’s confused again…” In a clip from the interview that Fox aired Friday, Trump claimed McConnell has supported trillions in spending on “projects that are Green New Deal.” The Green New Deal is a broad congressional resolution, supported by some Democratic legislators, that calls for major investments in a wide variety of environmental, social and economic initiatives. “Mitch McConnell: I mean, he’s agreed billions of dollars and trillions of dollars for projects that are Green New Deal – you know, I call it the Green New Scam – trillions of dollars for the Green New Scam,” Trump said. Facts First: Trump’s claim that McConnell has supported “trillions” in spending on Green New Deal projects is false even under a generous-to-Trump definition of what counts as a Green New Deal project. And as in the past, Trump failed to mention here that McConnell has been a vocal opponent of the Green New Deal congressional resolution as  a whole – and that Congress has never actually passed the resolution. McConnell has repeatedly denounced the Green New Deal resolution, describing it as, among other things, “radical,” “socialist” and a “mess.” So what is Trump talking about? Trump’s similar past attacks have been about how McConnell voted in 2021 for a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that contained spending that overlaps with some of the proposals in the wide-ranging Green New Deal resolution. For example, the 2021 infrastructure bill contained tens of billions in spending on cleaning up toxic waste sites, modernizing public transportation, increasing the country’s resilience against climate change, ensuring drinking water is clean, and facilitating a transition to zero- and low-emissions vehicles. But even if you were to count all of this as “Green New Deal” spending – which would be misleading given that the list includes priorities that both parties funded long before the Green New Deal was introduced in 2019 – the total would be in the hundreds of billions, not “trillions.” McConnell opposed a major Democratic bill in 2022 that spent hundreds of billions more on climate initiatives. Touting his performance on immigration policy, Trump claimed, as he has before, “I built 561 miles of wall.” Facts First: Trump’s “561 miles” claim is false, a substantial exaggeration. An official report by US Customs and Border Protection, written two days after Trump left office and subsequently obtained by CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said the number built under Trump was 458 miles (including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers). Even in his campaign speeches late last year, Trump sometimes put the figure, more correctly, at “nearly 500 miles.” You can read more here.

87,Apple’s Vision Pro headset hit US stores. Here’s what you need to know,"In recent weeks, Taylor Swift has been grabbing seemingly endless attention for the NFL with her attendance at boyfriend Travis Kelce’s games. But she also has heads turning for her fashion on and off the field, in particular as she has sported custom-made pieces courtesy of sportswear designer Kristin Juszczyk. Juszczyk, who describes herself as a “completely self-taught” designer, has built a following on social media re-working traditional sports jerseys, T-shirts and other merchandise (blankets, pillows and even footballs themselves) into trendy tailored pieces, from knee-length coats to corsets and miniskirts. Her designs emphasize sportswear iconography like logos and jersey numbers, taking a fashion-forward approach to football fandom. On her Instagram feed, Juszczyk frequently shares videos contrasting the before and after appearance of her pieces, as well as her design process. And the 29-year-old, who is married to San Francisco 49ers fullback Kyle Juszczyk, has just landed a licensing agreement with NFL, a spokesperson confirmed to CNN, allowing her to officially use NFL logos in men’s and women’s apparel. The deal was first reported by Sportico; CNN has reached out to Juszczyk for further comment. Juszczyk attended college in Rhode Island and later Maryland, graduating from Towson University with a degree in business administration and marketing. (It was in Maryland that she met her now husband, Juszczyk wrote on her website, as he was then playing for the Baltimore Ravens.) But she had learned how to sew at a young age and spent “countless nights crocheting with my grandma while watching ‘Wheel of Fortune’,” she wrote online. Her passion for the craft was reignited as an adult when she created a couples Halloween costume for herself and her husband. Her work caught the public eye in particular thanks to a puffer coat custom made for Taylor Swift — sporting Kansas City Chiefs’ Travis Kelce’s jersey number, 87 — which the singer wore to a Chiefs game January 13. But Swift isn’t the only one with a one-of-a-kind Juszczyk piece; Brittany Mahomes, who is married to Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, has a puffer with her husband’s number, and the designer has also made pieces for Simone Biles, who is married to Green Bay Packers’ Jonathan Owens, and Taylor Lautner, a big-time Detroit Lions fan. In an Instagram Reel Juszczyk shared showcasing the design process of Swift’s now iconic puffer jacket, Lautner may have predicted the deal in the comments sections:  “@NFL get this girl licensing stat,” he wrote. Attending the 49ers game on January 28 against the Lions, Juszczyk seemed to have no doubt her husband’s team would take home the win — and advance to the Super Bowl (where they will now face the Chiefs). When the game was over, Juszczyk rolled up the sleeves of the cascading full-length 49ers puffer jacket she was wearing and revealed the words “Super Bowl bound” embroidered within. So as the big game quickly approaches, those following Juszczyk are eager to see what the designer will have up her sleeve again. “I’m so proud of her. And she’s extremely talented, and the things she’s putting out there are one of a kind. I wanted to make sure she got that credit,” Kyle Juszczyk told NBC Sports Bay Area on January 16 when asked about his wife’s designs going viral.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/style/nfl-apparel-kristin-juszczyk-designer-taylor-swift-puffer/index.html,recent week taylor swift grabbing seemingly endless attention nfl attendance boyfriend travis kelce ’ game also head turning fashion field particular sported custommade piece courtesy sportswear designer kristin juszczyk juszczyk describes “ completely selftaught ” designer built following social medium reworking traditional sport jersey tshirts merchandise blanket pillow even football trendy tailored piece kneelength coat corset miniskirt design emphasize sportswear iconography like logo jersey number taking fashionforward approach football fandom instagram feed juszczyk frequently share video contrasting appearance piece well design process 29yearold married san francisco 49ers fullback kyle juszczyk landed licensing agreement nfl spokesperson confirmed cnn allowing officially use nfl logo men ’ woman ’ apparel deal first reported sportico cnn reached juszczyk comment juszczyk attended college rhode island later maryland graduating towson university degree business administration marketing maryland met husband juszczyk wrote website playing baltimore raven learned sew young age spent “ countless night crocheting grandma watching ‘ wheel fortune ’ ” wrote online passion craft reignited adult created couple halloween costume husband work caught public eye particular thanks puffer coat custom made taylor swift — sporting kansa city chief ’ travis kelce ’ jersey number eighty-seven — singer wore chief game january thirteen swift ’ one oneofakind juszczyk piece brittany mahomes married chief quarterback patrick mahomes puffer husband ’ number designer also made piece simone bile married green bay packer ’ jonathan owen taylor lautner bigtime detroit lion fan instagram reel juszczyk shared showcasing design process swift ’ iconic puffer jacket lautner may predicted deal comment section “ nfl get girl licensing stat ” wrote attending 49ers game january twenty-eight lion juszczyk seemed doubt husband ’ team would take home win — advance super bowl face chief game juszczyk rolled sleeve cascading fulllength 49ers puffer jacket wearing revealed word “ super bowl bound ” embroidered within big game quickly approach following juszczyk eager see designer sleeve “ ’ proud ’ extremely talented thing ’ putting one kind wanted make sure got credit ” kyle juszczyk told nbc sport bay area january sixteen asked wife ’ design going viral,0
88,Paytm was once India’s hottest startup. Its shares have crashed 36% in two days,"American golfer Wyndham Clark shot a course-record 60 as he moved into the lead at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am after three rounds. Clark’s historic round at the famous links course in California included two eagles and nine birdies, giving him a one-shot lead ahead of Sweden’s Ludvig Åberg. The US Open champion raced to a score of 10-under-par after 11 holes on Saturday and just missed out on shooting 59 or lower when a couple of late putts fell agonisingly short. It would have been the 13th sub-60 round in the history of the PGA Tour. “In my mind, I think in the past I would have coasted in and shot a nice eight, nine-under,” Clark told reporters after his round. “To keep the pedal down and to stay aggressive mentally I think was the most impressive thing to myself. “Then obviously making all of those putts out of the ordinary was also pretty awesome.” The only slight blemish during the 30-year-old’s performance was a bogey on the 12th hole, to which he responded with three birdies across the final six holes. After shooting 72 and 67 in the first two rounds, Clark surged to the top of the leaderboard with his 17-under total. The previous tournament course record of 62 for the tournament had been held jointly by Tom Kite, David Duval, Patrick Cantlay, and Matthias Schwab, according to the PGA Tour, while Hurly Long had shot the old competitive course record of 61 at a collegiate event in 2017. Due to bad weather throughout the week, the PGA Tour announced that “preferred lies” would be used across the first three rounds of the tournament, allowing golfers to lift, clean, and place their balls in short grass areas. The Tour, however, still refers to Clark’s round as a record. Åberg dropped off the top of the leaderboard but is only one shot behind Clark going into the final day after a third-round 67. France’s Matthieu Pavon, who won last week’s Farmers Insurance Open, is a further shot back in third, while USA’s Mark Hubbard and Belgium’s Thomas Detry are tied for fourth.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/sport/wyndham-clark-pebble-beach-record-spt-intl/index.html,american golfer wyndham clark shot courserecord sixty moved lead pebble beach proam three round clark ’ historic round famous link course california included two eagle nine birdie giving oneshot lead ahead sweden ’ ludvig åberg u open champion raced score 10underpar eleven hole saturday missed shooting fifty-nine lower couple late putt fell agonisingly short would 13th sub60 round history pga tour “ mind think past would coasted shot nice eight nineunder ” clark told reporter round “ keep pedal stay aggressive mentally think impressive thing “ obviously making putt ordinary also pretty awesome ” slight blemish 30yearold ’ performance bogey 12th hole responded three birdie across final six hole shooting seventy-two sixty-seven first two round clark surged top leaderboard 17under total previous tournament course record sixty-two tournament held jointly tom kite david duval patrick cantlay matthias schwab according pga tour hurly long shot old competitive course record sixty-one collegiate event two thousand and seventeen due bad weather throughout week pga tour announced “ preferred lie ” would used across first three round tournament allowing golfer lift clean place ball short grass area tour however still refers clark ’ round record åberg dropped top leaderboard one shot behind clark going final day thirdround sixty-seven france ’ matthieu pavon last week ’ farmer insurance open shot back third usa ’ mark hubbard belgium ’ thomas detry tied fourth,2
89,Amazon launches AI shopping assistant as holiday shoppers boost revenue,"Wednesday’s online youth safety hearing with some of the world’s leading social media CEOs was unlike the many that came before it in recent years. But it wasn’t because of anything the executives said. Instead, it was the families sitting behind them — many holding photos of children who had been harmed or died after engaging online — who set the tone for a hearing that was, after years of talk, focused on finally taking action to protect young social media users. The presence of parents in the hearing room served as a stark reminder of the reason for the event and prompted rare apologies from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel. During the hearing, Zuckerberg and Spiegel, along with the CEOs of TikTok, Discord and X, also faced calls to meet with the families affected by their platforms. And Wednesday night, after the event, some parents said the apologies did not go far enough. “I feel it was very fake, it lacked any heart behind it,” Bridget Norring, a mother in the room whose son died from an accidental fentanyl overdose after ordering a pill off of Snapchat in 2020, told CNN of Spiegel’s apology. “I just feel like for them, our children are just casualties, pawns, in this game to make money.” By Friday, only X and Discord indicated plans to meet with families or parent advocacy groups in the wake of the hearing, although the promises were light on details. “Yes, we will be actively engaging with all Senators and will absolutely work to determine connection with families,” X business operations head Joe Benarroch said in an email. X CEO Linda Yaccarino thanked the “parents, families, and young people” who attended the hearing in a post on the platform. She also pledged to support several proposed bills mentioned at the hearing. “No family should experience the pain of having a loved one fall victim to sexual exploitation online,” Clint Smith, Discord’s legal, policy and safety chief, said in an emailed statement to CNN. “We recognize our solemn and urgent responsibility to keep our users safe, especially young people. This is central to everything we do at Discord. We will continue our work with industry partners, experts, parents and law enforcement, as well as Congress and the Administration on this shared priority.” Snap’s Spiegel has previously met with parents whose children died of accidental fentanyl overdoses after purchasing drugs on the platform, according to the company. Snap also partners with the advocacy group Song for Charlie, a family-run nonprofit, to promote education for teens about the dangers of fentanyl and fake pills that can be laced with the deadly drug. In response to questions about whether Meta or Zuckerberg planned to meet with families, the company directed CNN to a blog post it published after the hearing that detailed its existing youth safety measures and parental oversight tools. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. Whether or not the companies ultimately agree to engage with them, these parents are likely to be a driving force in the ongoing effort to make social media platforms safer for children and teens. “Nothing can match the eloquence and power of those profoundly human statements about loss and pain and grief and harm,” Connecticut Democrat Sen. Richard Blumenthal said, addressing parents, in a press conference following Wednesday’s hearing. “We will win this battle because of you.” Minnesota Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar told CNN Wednesday evening that she felt “much more hopeful than I have for years on this, because those families [were] standing tall behind those CEOs.” Within 24 hours of the hearing’s end, parents were already urging senators to hold a vote on at least one of the many proposed bills that they’d tried to convince the tech CEOs to get on board with during the hearing. “We’re all relying on [New York Democrat Sen.] Chuck Schumer to bring the Kids Online Safety Act to the floor, and all of the yelling and screaming … won’t do anything unless Mr. Schumer moves that legislation,” Sam Chapman, a parent advocate whose son died after an accidental fentanyl overdose from a pill he bought on Snapchat, told CNN Thursday. “Talk is cheap and actions speak louder than words, and it’s time for action from the social media companies and our legislators.” The Kids Online Safety Act is a hot-button bill that would force tech companies to take steps to design and operate their platforms in a way that would mitigate certain potential harms to young users. On Thursday, Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he plans to try to force a vote next week on a bill aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation online. The bill, known as the STOP CSAM Act, is co-sponsored by the panel’s Democratic Chairman Dick Durbin. Hawley told reporters that he would attempt to pass the bill by unanimous consent sometime next week — meaning any single senator can block its passage. “We just saw yesterday the extent of the damage that this has done, these platforms have done,” he said. “We saw yesterday Mark Zuckerberg apologize to these families, finally, and apologies are nice. But it’s time for Congress to act now, and it’s time to give these families the ability to hold these platforms accountable… I think yesterday can be a turning point, if we’re willing to make it a turning point, and the time to act is now.” –CNN’s Brian Fung and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/03/tech/social-media-ceos-hearing-families-push-legislation/index.html,wednesday ’ online youth safety hearing world ’ leading social medium ceo unlike many came recent year ’ anything executive said instead family sitting behind — many holding photo child harmed died engaging online — set tone hearing year talk focused finally taking action protect young social medium user presence parent hearing room served stark reminder reason event prompted rare apology meta ceo mark zuckerberg snap ceo evan spiegel hearing zuckerberg spiegel along ceo tiktok discord x also faced call meet family affected platform wednesday night event parent said apology go far enough “ feel fake lacked heart behind ” bridget norring mother room whose son died accidental fentanyl overdose ordering pill snapchat two thousand and twenty told cnn spiegel ’ apology “ feel like child casualty pawn game make money ” friday x discord indicated plan meet family parent advocacy group wake hearing although promise light detail “ yes actively engaging senator absolutely work determine connection family ” x business operation head joe benarroch said email x ceo linda yaccarino thanked “ parent family young people ” attended hearing post platform also pledged support several proposed bill mentioned hearing “ family experience pain loved one fall victim sexual exploitation online ” clint smith discord ’ legal policy safety chief said emailed statement cnn “ recognize solemn urgent responsibility keep user safe especially young people central everything discord continue work industry partner expert parent law enforcement well congress administration shared priority ” snap ’ spiegel previously met parent whose child died accidental fentanyl overdoses purchasing drug platform according company snap also partner advocacy group song charlie familyrun nonprofit promote education teen danger fentanyl fake pill laced deadly drug response question whether meta zuckerberg planned meet family company directed cnn blog post published hearing detailed existing youth safety measure parental oversight tool tiktok respond request comment whether company ultimately agree engage parent likely driving force ongoing effort make social medium platform safer child teen “ nothing match eloquence power profoundly human statement loss pain grief harm ” connecticut democrat sen richard blumenthal said addressing parent press conference following wednesday ’ hearing “ win battle ” minnesota democrat sen amy klobuchar told cnn wednesday evening felt “ much hopeful year family standing tall behind ceo ” within twenty-four hour hearing ’ end parent already urging senator hold vote least one many proposed bill ’ tried convince tech ceo get board hearing “ ’ relying new york democrat sen chuck schumer bring kid online safety act floor yelling screaming … ’ anything unless mr schumer move legislation ” sam chapman parent advocate whose son died accidental fentanyl overdose pill bought snapchat told cnn thursday “ talk cheap action speak louder word ’ time action social medium company legislator ” kid online safety act hotbutton bill would force tech company take step design operate platform way would mitigate certain potential harm young user thursday missouri republican sen josh hawley said plan try force vote next week bill aimed protecting child sexual exploitation online bill known stop csam act cosponsored panel ’ democratic chairman dick durbin hawley told reporter would attempt pas bill unanimous consent sometime next week — meaning single senator block passage “ saw yesterday extent damage done platform done ” said “ saw yesterday mark zuckerberg apologize family finally apology nice ’ time congress act ’ time give family ability hold platform accountable… think yesterday turning point ’ willing make turning point time act ” –cnn ’ brian fung morgan rimmer contributed report,8
90,"Apple sales boost profits, but China struggles continue","Amos Shani Atzmon says he doesn’t blame Palestinians in Gaza for hating Israel right now. “They have really good reasons. When you see cities on fire and are getting bombed … I had one close friend killed in Gaza and I am thinking about the people whose entire families died in bombing,” he said. An Israel Defence Forces (IDF) reservist, Atzmon, 26, was called up just hours after Hamas launched its brutal terror attack on Israel, murdering around 1,200 people and kidnapping 253 others. Israel swiftly retaliated to the October 7 assault with a massive aerial bombardment campaign, followed by a ground operation. More than 27,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in the enclave. According to UN agencies, 400,000 Gazans are at risk of starving. The ministry does not distinguish between Hamas fighters and civilians, but says about 70% of the casualties are women and children. Israel estimates it has killed about 10,000 Hamas militants since October 7. CNN is not able to independently confirm those numbers. The international community, including some of Israel’s closest allies, are increasingly horrified at the scale of the violence inflicted on civilians in Gaza. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) found that it was “plausible” that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza and ordered Israel to “take all measures” to limit the death and destruction caused by its military campaign, prevent and punish incitement to genocide, and ensure access to humanitarian aid. The decision by ICJ is not a ruling on whether Israel’s actions constitute genocide. Regardless, little has changed on the ground. Atzmon said he is the “left-wing guy” in his unit. Like tens of thousands of others, he had spent most of last spring and summer protesting against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his plans to overhaul Israel’s judiciary. Netanyahu’s government is the most right-wing in Israel’s history, rejecting the idea of a Palestinian state and supporting Jewish settlements inside the West Bank. Atzmon, meanwhile, wants Israel to work towards a two-state solution. “The Palestinian people will never stop fighting us until they have their own autonomy. And I think the end goal needs to be that,” he said. His political views are sometimes difficult to square with the realities of being a soldier, fighting on behalf of a government he doesn’t support. He says he’s been grappling with this since he started forming his political opinions around the age of 15, anticipating his military service – something almost everyone in Israel must complete. “I’m devastated about the death of people in Gaza, kids, the elderly. Just normal men (aged) 26, like me, we don’t want to die. But I have the right to defend myself and to defend my family, my friends, my loved ones,” he said, rejecting the notion that the Hamas terror attack was an act of “resistance” against the Israeli blockade. “I’m not saying this is not a complex situation. But I’m 100% sure that I’m on the right side of history, and that I’m trying to defend people.” “What happened in the kibbutzim felt like the most inhuman thing I ever witnessed. So when I’m facing this kind of evil, I felt, and I still feel, that entering the war is the only way. Because these are not people I can speak with or comprehend,” he added. Hundreds of people were murdered in Be’eri, Nir Oz, Kfar Azza and other kibbutzim near the Gaza perimeter. Atzmon said he wants Netanyahu, who is on trial for bribery, fraud and breach of trust, out of the office – the sooner the better. “He should have resigned on the 7th of October. I wanted to wake up on the 8th and watch him on TV telling people ‘I have failed you and I’m sorry. I’m stepping down,’ but that didn’t happen,” he said, adding that he would have welcomed nearly anyone else in the role. Studying to become a social worker, Atzmon is passionate about his political beliefs. Yet as a soldier, he has fought shoulder to shoulder with people whose opinions couldn’t be further from his own. Military service is mandatory for all Jewish citizens and for male Druze and Circassian citizens of Israel. Arab citizens and ultra-orthodox Jews are exempt from service, although they may choose to join. The strict conscription laws mean the military is politically as diverse as Israeli society. People who wouldn’t cross paths otherwise are suddenly thrust together and forced to overcome their differences. Emmanuel, a 35-year-old reservist currently serving in a combat unit in and around the Gaza Strip, is as passionately right-wing as Atzmon is left-wing. Unlike Atzmon, Emmanuel is still on active duty and is officially prohibited from speaking to journalists. He has therefore asked CNN not to publish his full name. He believes Israel will need to control Gaza for years to come, agreeing with Netanyuahu who said he wants Israel to have “overall security responsibility” in the strip for an “indefinite period” after the war ends. Emmanuel said the West Bank could serve as a blueprint for the future of Gaza. The fact that he refers to the area by its biblical name and ancient Israelite kingdoms  – “Judea and Samaria” – is just a small reminder that in this region of divisions and complexities, the words one chooses speak volumes of one’s convictions. Using the biblical name of the ancient homeland of the Jewish people is one way the Israeli government tries to legitimize Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law. Atzmon, on the other hand, calls it the West Bank and says he is “very sure” that it is under occupation. “[The Palestinians] should control their own area like they do in (some parts) of Judea and Samaria, but where Israel has access to every village and every city,” Emmanuel told CNN in a phone interview, speaking from his base near the Gaza Strip. “If we want to enter Ramallah, it is not a problem. We enter Ramallah, we neutralize the threat.” Some of Netanyahu’s coalition partners are going a step further, proposing to build Jewish settlements in Gaza. The issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank is already a major fault line within Israeli society and in the country’s diplomatic relationships. The idea of building settlements in Gaza has alarmed Israel’s allies, with the United States’ top diplomat rebuking the plans. Netanyahu himself has so far rejected the idea of new settlements in Gaza as “unrealistic,” saying in an English-language statement that “Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.” But Emmanuel supports that idea. “We must establish new settlements. Not because we want to wipe out the Palestinians. No. We must have a real clear win over our enemies that everybody will understand. This is the price that you pay if you mess with us,” he said.   Over 1.9 million people in Gaza, or nearly 85% of the population, are estimated to be internally displaced, according to the United Nations. Efforts to force them put of their homes permanently would be a breach of international law – and are among the arguments presented by South Africa in its ICJ case against Israel.   “And the second reason is security. We know from Judea and Samaria that it’s easier to control the security in the area if you have settlements there,” he said. The divisions and arguments within the Israeli society over the future of Gaza and the West Bank have become even deeper and more heated since the October 7 attacks. Not everyone gets involved, however. For 19-year-old combat soldier Mendel, the political disagreements seem a bit meaningless at this point. “The politics … it really doesn’t matter. You’re in the army and you’re there to protect the people and protect each other. And it doesn’t matter what you think, or what you look like or where you’re from,” he told CNN in an interview at a Jerusalem retreat center run by Never Alone, an organization that provides support to “lone soldiers” without family in Israel. An American from Long Island, Mendel decided to join the IDF after living in Israel for a few years. Unlike Emmanuel and Atzmon, Mendel does not have previous military experience. He was drafted just a few months before the war broke out and has since been deployed to Gaza as part of the Netzah Yehuda Battalion – an IDF unit that is specifically designed to accommodate religious servicemen. He has also asked CNN not to publish his full name due to his active service. He said that when being drafted, he didn’t think he would be involved in a war. But things have changed on October 7, he said.   “They are still holding hostages there. What do you want us to do? If we back out and they still have our hostages? What would you do if that was you? What would you want your family doing if that was you?” According to the IDF, 224 Israeli troops have been killed in Gaza since the ground operation began in late October. Among them, Atzmon said, was his best friend, who was killed in a battle in southern Gaza in late December. Atzmon told CNN the two had many conversations about the war and the civilians caught up in it — something he regards as part of their duty as soldiers. “It’s our obligation to think about it and discuss it because the distance between fighting for your loved ones and killing people for revenge is really, really small,” he said during an interview in Jerusalem on Wednesday, just a few days after returning from his deployment. He said he believes that individual soldiers and the military in general must continually have conversations about what is proportionate force. “Because if we’re not, if we’re entering Gaza and doing whatever we want out of pure revenge, then we’re going to be as bad as Hamas. And we’re not. I am not going to let them turn me into a murderer,” he said. But many outside Israel argue the limits of proportionality have been crossed. In an unprecedented display of coordinated dissent, more than 800 officials from the United States and Europe signed a scathing criticism of Western policy towards Israel and Gaza, accusing their governments of possible complicity in war crimes. Emmanuel said he too sympathizes with innocent civilians. But he said he believes fighting the war the way it is currently conducted is the only option. He said that successive Israeli governments were wrong to believe that keeping Gaza sealed off and under blockade would “manage” the situation. “I don’t believe that Churchill or Roosevelt thought they can manage Hitler. There’s no managing your enemies. Either we let them wipe out our country or we defeat them,” he said. “And to be clear, we are not at war with the Palestinian people in Gaza. Our war is with Hamas. Nobody wants to kill an innocent civilian, an innocent woman, an innocent child – but if we have to fight a war, there are casualties. ” Mendel, by far the youngest of the trio, said he feels strongly about the “horrible” injustice of innocent people dying. “Wars shouldn’t happen, (Hamas) should not have started this and none of this would have happened,” he said. “And I don’t think that starting it justifies any civilians dying, but it’s a war and war is a horrible, brutal thing, but it’s either that or they would have massacred the rest of us with smiles on their faces.” Most of all, he said he just wants the war to end. He said he misses his family, his mom especially. “She is the best of all,” he said. “And she makes the best challah in the world,” he added, referring to the traditional Jewish braided bread served on special occasions. Mendel has some two years left of his military service. Whether the war will end by the time he finishes is anyone’s guess.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/middleeast/israeli-soldiers-political-war/index.html,"amos shani atzmon say ’ blame palestinian

91,Congress hasn’t been able to make social media safer. Here’s why,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, where one person dies every 33 seconds from cardiovascular disease. In total, heart disease claims the lives of 1 in 5 people. February is American Heart Month, so it’s worth the reminder that taking care of your heart can help extend your life span and improve the quality of your life. This week, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen about the steps that everyone can take — no matter their age, current lifestyle habits or preexisting medical conditions. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner. CNN: Let’s start with people in their teens and 20s. Cardiovascular disease is extremely rare at this age. Why should young people start thinking about taking care of their hearts? Dr. Leana Wen: First, it’s important to build healthy habits early. Health is not just about the avoidance of disease; it’s also about overall physical and emotional well-being. Some things that people in their teens and 20s can start paying attention to include physical activity, nutrition and substance use. While paying attention to these issues can help you feel better in the short term, you also benefit your heart in the long term. Everyone should aim for at least 150 minutes a week of moderate- to high-intensity exercise. This should not feel like a chore; the more physical activity becomes incorporated as an enjoyable part of daily routine, the more it is likely to be continued throughout the years. Now is the time to find sports that you enjoy. There’s an added bonus if you can find community through physical activity. Is there a running group, rock climbing club or swim group you could join? What about a volleyball, soccer or frisbee league? Find something you enjoy, and that will increase your odds that you will do it consistently. This is also the age to start building healthy eating habits. That includes planning nutritious meals and aiming to consume more whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, milk, fish and meat. Other eating habits to strive for include cutting down consumption of ultraprocessed “junk foods” and not eating just before bed. Younger people should also be attentive to substance use. Smokers have two to four times the risk of developing heart disease and strokes compared with nonsmokers, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Excessive alcohol use also has detrimental effects on the heart. People should follow the federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which recommend no more than one alcoholic drink a day for women and two for men on days that they are drinking. And beware also of cannabis use. Recent studies point to regular marijuana use being associated with higher rates of heart attack, stroke and heart failure. In addition to building good habits early, younger people should keep in mind that the damage to their bodies from unhealthy choices could carry over in years to come. That’s another reason it’s good to start early with establishing heart-healthy practices. CNN: What about people in their 30s and 40s? What cardiovascular health practices should they be most attentive to? Wen: They should keep up a healthy diet and be aware of the risks associated with smoking and excessive alcohol. With regard to exercise, I want to point out a recent study that found desk-bound workers had a 34% higher risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease compared with people who did not predominantly sit at work. Everyone should follow exercise guidelines; those who are sitting a lot at work should take extra care to get up frequently during the day. This is also the time to think about two additional factors: stress and sleep. Plenty of research points to high levels of stress increasing blood pressure and increasing the risk of having strokes and heart attacks. While stress is a normal human reaction that everyone experiences, sustained high levels of stress can be problematic. Look out for symptoms of elevated stress and be mindful of what works for you to reduce stress in your life. Along these lines, studies have also shown that sleep is important to cardiovascular health. In fact, some research indicates that sleep may be as important as diet and physical activity. For instance, people who sleep less than seven hours nightly had a higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure — all significant risk factors for heart disease. Those with irregular sleep patterns also appear to be at higher risk for cardiovascular disease. There are several strategies that can help achieve better sleep, including establishing a regular bedtime routine and eliminating blue light before bed. Cutting back on alcohol can help, too. Finally, many people in this age group may be busy with a variety of responsibilities, including child-rearing, work and caring for older family members. Just don’t skip your annual physical exam. This is how you can identify if you have chronic conditions that can increase your likelihood of heart disease. CNN: Let’s talk about the 50s and 60s. What are key strategies for this age group? Wen: The prevalence of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, increases with increasing age. Many people in this age group will have a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease or major risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol and obesity. Good control of these conditions will reduce the incidence of strokes and heart attacks. People should take medications as prescribed. Continue regular checkups and make sure that the chronic conditions are managed optimally. It may help to keep a diary. For instance, track your blood pressure or your blood sugars and show the diary to your health care provider so that medication dosages can be adjusted. Many of these conditions will also improve with changes in lifestyle. It isn’t too late to begin exercise, improve dietary habits and reduce substance use. Those starting from scratch for physical activity should know that there are substantial gains in cardiovascular health for people who go from no exercise to some. And people who quit smoking, even later in life, can reverse some adverse effects. Those who wish to address their smoking, drinking and other use of substances should consult their physicians. A variety of tools exist to help them, including medications and counseling. CNN: And for people in their 70s, 80s, 90s and beyond? Wen: There are definitely ways to improve heart health at these ages, too. Everything mentioned above applies, with some modifications. Some people may have physical limitations, for instance, but they can still exercise with adjustments. Some may need to see their physicians more often, depending on the medical conditions they have. And everyone should be attentive to signs of emergencies like heart attack and stroke, and not hesitate to seek medical attention. I’d like to add one more thing. It applies to people of all ages, but older people may face some challenges in an often-overlooked determinant of heart health: social connection. Loneliness is an epidemic in the United States and globally, and is associated with many negative health effects that include worse cardiovascular health and early mortality. People of all ages should think of social connections as being important not just to their relationships and emotional health but also to improving physical well-being. Seemingly small changes can make a big difference, especially if they are habits sustained throughout decades.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/health/improve-heart-health-wellness/index.html,heart

92,Why was a revolting YouTube video of a purported decapitated head left online for hours?,"Paytm, once the hottest of India’s startups, has seen a stunning fall on the stock market since last week, extending a plunge that has wiped nearly 80% off its value since it went public in the country’s biggest IPO in 2021. Shares of the hugely popular digital payments company have crashed by the daily maximum allowed in Mumbai for three days in a row as of Monday, even though India’s stock markets have been touching new all-time highs. Paytm is down 42% since Wednesday’s close of trading and is almost 32% lower this year. The company has struggled since its disastrous market debut in November 2021, when it failed to convince investors that it could become profitable in the face of growing competition from homegrown rivals and American tech firms. It also landed in hot water with regulators — two years ago, the central bank barred its banking arm from signing up new customers. Paytm stock is now trading at just 438 rupees (around $5) a share. The crash over the past two days has wiped out $2.4 billion in market capitalization alone, leaving the company worth just $3.3 billion. The latest plunge came after India’s central bank cracked down further on its business. The Reserve bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday ordered Paytm Payments Bank to stop taking deposits, along with other key services, citing “persistent non-compliances.” Since the notice, which caught India’s tech community by surprise, Paytm has swung into fire-fighting mode to try to calm investors and its 300 million-plus customers. But its assurance that it is taking “immediate steps” to comply with regulators as well as a conference call held after market hours on Thursday have failed to stop the meltdown. The RBI order is a “reputational risk to the overall Paytm business and casts doubt over the visibility of [its] business performance in future,” said Manish Chowdhury, head of research at brokerage StoxBox. Paytm launched its payments bank in 2017 as a joint venture with founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma. At that time, it could accept deposits but not lend money to customers. In the Thursday call, Sharma said the central bank’s action “is more of a speed bump,” and that going forward Paytm will work only with other banks. The company also denied media reports it is being investigated for money laundering by India’s financial crime fighting agency. “Neither the company nor its founder and CEO are being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate,” it said in a filing on Sunday. “In the past, certain merchants/users on our platforms have been subject to enquiries and on those occasions, we have always cooperated with the authorities.” Paytm’s app became a household name in the country in 2016, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly banned the country’s two biggest currency notes — around 86% of the country’s cash at the time — with the aim of cracking down on tax evasion and illegal wealth. The move was hugely disruptive for the economy, but it helped Paytm grow at an explosive rate: The company signed 10 million new users within a month. It made us “a folklore name in this country,” Sharma told CNN in 2019.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/02/tech/paytm-india-rbi-intl-hnk/index.html,paytm hottest india ’ startup seen stunning fall stock market since last week extending plunge wiped nearly eighty value since went public country ’ biggest ipo two thousand and twenty-one share hugely popular digital payment company crashed daily maximum allowed mumbai three day row monday even though india ’ stock market touching new alltime high paytm forty-two since wednesday ’ close trading almost thirty-two lower year company struggled since disastrous market debut november two thousand and twenty-one failed convince investor could become profitable face growing competition homegrown rival american tech firm also landed hot water regulator — two year ago central bank barred banking arm signing new customer paytm stock trading four hundred and thirty-eight rupee around five share crash past two day wiped twenty-four billion market capitalization alone leaving company worth thirty-three billion latest plunge came india ’ central bank cracked business reserve bank india rbi wednesday ordered paytm payment bank stop taking deposit along key service citing “ persistent noncompliance ” since notice caught india ’ tech community surprise paytm swung firefighting mode try calm investor three hundred millionplus customer assurance taking “ immediate step ” comply regulator well conference call held market hour thursday failed stop meltdown rbi order “ reputational risk overall paytm business cast doubt visibility business performance future ” said manish chowdhury head research brokerage stoxbox paytm launched payment bank two thousand and seventeen joint venture founder vijay shekhar sharma time could accept deposit lend money customer thursday call sharma said central bank ’ action “ speed bump ” going forward paytm work bank company also denied medium report investigated money laundering india ’ financial crime fighting agency “ neither company founder ceo investigated enforcement directorate ” said filing sunday “ past certain merchantsusers platform subject enquiry occasion always cooperated authority ” paytm ’ app became household name country two thousand and sixteen indian prime minister narendra modi suddenly banned country ’ two biggest currency note — around eighty-six country ’ cash time — aim cracking tax evasion illegal wealth move hugely disruptive economy helped paytm grow explosive rate company signed ten million new user within month made u “ folklore name country ” sharma told cnn two thousand and nineteen,9
